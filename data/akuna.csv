Smart and hardworking people who are valued. There seems to be opportunity to grow along with the company because it is growing so much. Work-life balance has positively surprised me - definite sense of understanding that people have lives and interests outside of work, ability to use travel days and leave at normal hours without being shamed. Opportunities to get to know coworkers in social settings outside of the office too. Feels entrepreneurial by nature, employees are encouraged to be self-starters and always be looking for ways to improve Akuna and themselves. Leadership is great, very open-minded people who look for ways to help people grow and develop. Leadership is passionate about Akuna: constantly looking for ways to help Akuna continue to grow and become an industry leader.

Terrible work/life balance: there are constant ""initiatives"" that you have to complete yesterday so the compnay can succeed. When we deliver, and profit the leadership does not share the gains. No or low bonuses. CEO micro manages everything. He is leading developer scrums and telling HR how to do their job better. The CEO also plays favortism with certain ethnic groups. If you are Australian you are well liked, otherwise you are on the outside of the decision making loop. Arrogant and inexperienced are the key words here. Also I would like to mention that the CEO walks around in his bare feet all the time which is super classy.
