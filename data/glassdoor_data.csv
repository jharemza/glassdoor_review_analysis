Smart and hardworking people who are valued. There seems to be opportunity to grow along with the company because it is growing so much. Work-life balance has positively surprised me - definite sense of understanding that people have lives and interests outside of work, ability to use travel days and leave at normal hours without being shamed. Opportunities to get to know coworkers in social settings outside of the office too. Feels entrepreneurial by nature, employees are encouraged to be self-starters and always be looking for ways to improve Akuna and themselves. Leadership is great, very open-minded people who look for ways to help people grow and develop. Leadership is passionate about Akuna: constantly looking for ways to help Akuna continue to grow and become an industry leader.

Wed Oct 16 2019 08:57:29 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Data Production Analyst,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Every Opportunity to Succeed,I have been working at Citadel full-time for more than 10 years,1,"Regardless of your role, you will be given every resource you need to not only meet your team’s mandate, but to grow and progress your own career. You will find that top-tier talent is easily approachable, willing to collaborate, and often within arms-reach of you. The work you produce is valued and your opinions on implementation will be heard if you can sufficiently support your view. Employees who reach a point where they feel stuck in their career, or have a desire to seek out new challenges, have options. Those who have proven they can exceed expectations are given every opportunity to explore other areas of the firm where they may add value. Management recognizes this and is fully supportive of internal moves that better align employees with their core skills and interests. It is also a firm where your work has an immediate and tangible impact and you can quickly become the owner of a high-value process. This extends to work that may on the surface appear to be somewhat trivial but supports a critical function at the firm. Front-office colleagues and investment teams take pride in the hard work being done at every level and will often go out of their way to recognize individuals who continually deliver. There is constant focus on finding and working with cutting edge (not bleeding edge) technology that better positions the firm to succeed, and there is an underlying expectation that you will scrutinize and review prior implementations. There are endless complex problems to be solved and this seems to really foster a culture of innovation.","While the resources and opportunities are endless, it is ultimately up to you to determine how to best leverage them. No one is going to give you a full roadmap on how to navigate your role and grow your skillset. This can often be a challenge for those who thrive on structure or have a more traditional view of how their career should progress. Citadel is also constantly evolving and pushing the limits at all levels and this can be daunting for people who might not enjoy changing requirements, context-shifting or re-engineering recently completed work. Expectations are accordingly high, and this can sometime be overwhelming for employees who aren’t deeply invested in the task or problem at hand. Lastly, for central or common roles where there is no PnL tied directly to your name, finding ways to add value that can be quantified is always challenge, particularly for those that don’t have an interest in finance or fully appreciate what the main function of the firm it (or have a desire to learn it).",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,citadel

You can make an impact right away and have ownership over your projects. This comes with more responsibilities and you get to interact with the stakeholders of your work. Having ownership means that you can see your project from initial design through to production. Since the people that use the software that you build are internal clients, you get feedback constantly, resulting in a fast paced iteration process. You will be learning alot really quickly and get to develop not only technical skills, but also communication, leadership, and financial skills. teams are generally pretty small and generally collaborative. The company has a very flat sturcture and results oriented. As a junior developer, quant, or trader, you have many opportunities to interact with leaders in management across different functions.","Citadel is split among different businesses. As an engineer, you will be supporting traders and researchers who generate money for those businesses. Not all the businesses have the same culture and thus team experiences could differ. This also means that there will be a team with a business need and culture that you will find compelling. Some teams' work life balance isn't too great and do work very long hours. Usually it is because the projects they work on are very time sensitive and high margin. Turnover is relatively high as some new people may not fit in well with the team and/or business.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,citadel

Management is full of people who make upper management happy, but can't manage down. Expect to get a great review and then get fired a couple months later without explanation.

Said management who knew nothing about the job they were doing and was simply there to make the CEO happy.

You are encouraged to diversify your skillset by constantly learning on and off the job. On different projects, I have not only been the software developer but also a product manager, quant researcher or product evangelist based on what aspect of the project interested me. Talented peers from different backgrounds are always willing to help you learn new skills. * As someone who joined through the new grad program, a lot of support and guidance was provided in terms of classes, tech talks, speaker series, and various mentorship programs. The rotational program also allows you to find a team that is a perfect fit for you. * Titles mean very little at Citadel and the organization structure is very flat. Junior people who show promise are encouraged to take on more responsibility and are pulled into mission-critical projects. * Portfolio Managers, traders, and analysts appreciate the importance of technology and quant research and are constantly trying to incorporate it into their investment process. Citadel is especially rewarding for those engineers who are willing to put the effort to understand financial markets. Software developers are constantly reminded that they are there to solve problems and not just write code.","* Citadel demands 100% from its teams and individual members every year. This leads to a cycle of a multiyear period of stability (4-5 years) followed by a short period of turnover (6-8 months). This cycle has it's obvious cons but for ambitious team members, the period of turnover actually creates a lot of opportunities. * Software developers are encouraged to understand and solve problems. Sometimes these problems are ambiguous and the specs provided are loose. If you are scared by ambiguity, then this may not be the best place for you. 60-40% split of long term vs short term projects. Engineers, especially in the front office, may be required to context switch based on market conditions. * Citadel is a big consumer of open source projects but doesn't have a strong culture of contributing back to them.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,citadel

The culture is centered around performance - there is an obvious, stated mandate that everyone perform at their peak capability 100% of the time, while constantly stretching that peak as much as possible. This is not your traditional finance company culture of ""facetime"" whereby those who are visible at their desk 24/7 are promoted and praised. Instead, those who contribute, exceed their goals, and bring the whole team forward are considered the top performers. And, of course, top performers are rewarded accordingly - not with badges of pride or soft praise, but with concrete results. If that's what you're looking for, Citadel is the place to be. From a technologist's perspective, there are infinite opportunities to learn from your peers, many of whom have different backgrounds, or completely different skillsets to offer. You may find yourself working with former nuclear physicists, or former fed chairmen; each interaction is a chance to level-up each other, and to learn something new. Of course, there are the perks: breakfast and lunch available in the office, stipends for teams to hold events, frequent company-wide outings (read: sporting events, broadway shows, etc.), and top-notch comp.","As with any company in an expansion phase, there are some growing pains. That said, those at Citadel have been less than at companies in similar phases. There are active efforts to mitigate bureaucracy, but occasionally they fall a little short.

This always leaves one feeling like there is never a shortage of learning opportunities. At the same time, there are a large amount of resources to lean on, spanning compute infrastructure, data ingestion, infosec, etc. It is very straightforward to feel your impact on and stay connected to the business, as projects require direct and ongoing communication with stakeholders and are designed from the onset to be quantitatively measurable.

Through this project I was not only an architect and engineer, but also a product manager, user support and salesman. I have learned that this is typical of the most successful engineers at Citadel. In order to succeed you need to not only design systems, but also intimately understand the problems we are solving and how they relate to making money and managing risk. If you cannot incorporate the last two components into the systems you design, you will not be successful. However if you can, there is no ceiling. I now work in data engineering for the fundamental equities businesses working on problems that enable our investment teams to gain insights from a variety of data sources. We get access to data sets that no one else gets to work with, using cutting-edge techniques with A LOT of compute resources.

Immediate firing and escorted out - HR comes and slams stuff in boxes with no respect for the items - family photos mangled and likely needed possessions sitting for weeks before being returned to employees. -All hours (middle of night on weekend) phone calls/people screamed at for minor issues -No tolerance for stuff that is pretty normal in other modern offices, like working from home occasionally or leaving a tad early to catch a train - I guess the VPN is only there so that they can make you work on vacation -For all of the above, pay is not that much better than other comparable employers and benefits (especially to include families) are actually a lot worse than many other similar companies -You will most certainly not get promoted in back office functions without putting in a huge number of years (10+), and even then it's not likely",,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,,Disapproves of CEO,citadel

Sun Apr 16 2017 07:53:26 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Operations Associate,I worked at Citadel full-time for more than 3 years,21,"Citadel is an extremely professional environment where everybody takes their jobs very seriously. Management is very engaged, knowledgeable, and in the weeds of what is going on. Nobody lasts at Citadel due to anything besides merit. Great compensation. Your salary will be the highest that there is in the industry. Catered breakfast/lunch/dinner.","There are two key problems with working in any BO/MO position at Citadel: 1. You have no future within the company doing anything besides what you are doing now. HR and your manager(s) may pretend like there will be opportunities, but that will never happen and you can look at the people at the firm for proof. Nobody transitions into anything desirable. Advancements are in title only. There are people that have been there for 10 years and are 'managers' and even directors that are doing the same menial work that interns will do. There is zero chance for professional growth or career development. The leadership is entrenched (if you would even want their jobs) and not leaving anytime soon. Stay far away if you are ambitious because, despite the name and compensation, it is very much a dead end for your career. Your only hope for meaningful career advancement is to leave for another firm after 3-5 years (which is all Citadel is trying to get out of you). 2. You are compensated more because you are expected to work dramatically more hours than comparable positions anywhere else. On an hourly basis, you are paid the same as people anywhere else, often even less. It is common to work >12hr days in a MO or BO role at Citadel and not uncommon to see people putting in 14 hour days and working weekends. This happens because there is consistent understaffing and a lack of respect for life outside of work. The claim from management is that you need to 'leverage technology,' which is mostly unsubstantiated rhetoric. Many things cannot (currently) be automated. This would be tolerable if there was any future for people willing to put in such work, but there is not.",,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,Approves of CEO,,,citadel

There are multiple bug tracking tools, code repository systems, wikis, and even chat/communication tools and it varies from department to department and team to team who uses what. This makes collaboration nearly impossible. - Very difficult to make an impact on the tech since it's so spread out. - You could end up on a very silo'd team with very little access to anything and your boss expects you to work all the time (including nights and weekends). - Lots of teams want to just buy solutions and build their own spaghetti systems instead of leveraging what's already been built elsewhere (within Citadel and from the open source community). Sometimes this isn't even really their fault - they just don't know what's out there. - Some of the code you'll find is comically bad because of deadlines, ""not invented here"" syndrome, and simply asking quants and traders to build software. This goes for use and abuse of databases and queuing technologies as well. - Very little service-oriented architecture. Lots of monoliths.

Free meals, but no cafeteria - they want you to work at your desk so you'll work longer hours. And so you'll stay in your little cubbyhole where you belong and not interact with anybody who ""doesn't need to know"" (a key buzzword at this paranoid firm).","Manager was horrendously insecure and micro-managed everything in a field he had no business or experience to justify doing so (if micro-managing is ever justifiable). HR and manager's boss didn't seem to care that he was doing this - even after informing them he bought an expensive board without consulting his subordinates and it was effectively useless for what he wanted to do with it - something that could have been avoided if this guy had put his ego aside and asked the people working for him with more experience & knowledge. Company has a highly secretive culture - at least two people were hired into our group without my knowledge. Granted, I wasn't a manager myself, but I'm generally accustomed to being permitted to interview candidates I'm going to work with and at least make a recommendation. You're also not allowed to talk to ANYONE because of this whole ""need to know"" BS that permeates the whole place. If you're coming from the tech sector and are used to being allowed to talk to people in other groups to get an idea of what it is they want, forget about doing that here. The Insecure Micro-Manager is your gatekeeper here. He will dictate the specifications and how he wants you to build your design. He will not care about your feedback or warnings about his architecture because his ego is too big. Then 2 weeks after you make your delivery and move on to the next project, Micro-Manager will tell you that the requirements weren't defined right and you need to go back to the old project and fix it so the internal customers will be happy. Something that clearly could be avoided by just letting us interact directly with the internal customers rather than carry this whole ""need to know"" concept to the paranoid extreme that exists at Citadel. I'll say two more things that sums up the company culture here. About 6 months through my one-year stint at this place, there was a company-wide meeting where a friend of CEO Ken Griffin gave a talk about something. Following the presentation, there was a reception afterward. It dawned on me that I knew NOBODY there beyond my manager and colleagues at this reception. And if you held a gun to my head today and told me to name more than 6 or 7 people who work for Citadel (never mind titles or departments or anything), I'd end up with a hole in my head. Just stay away. This place is just not worth the trouble or the pay. Or dealing with Micro-Manager's ego.",,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,citadel

Tack on the other perks (catered meals, in-house gym, discounts on things such as cellular plans and museum memberships, commuter benefits, the sheer amount of in-house education taught by industry & academic leaders) and you won't fit better overall compensation in Chicago. The culture of compliance (legally speaking) gives you a feeling of stability. As much as we all hate going to those meetings for ""re-education"", it's comforting to know that regulations are taken seriously and people are willing to reach out for help when they've made a mistake. Citadel proves firms can prosper regardless of the regulatory environment.","Like most hedge funds, the org chart is very flat. You will be rewarded through comp, but if you desire more than money, the upward mobility is pretty limited. For many years, there was a saying that Citadel is a ""technology firm that happens to trade"". This is ridiculous. The technology at Citadel is very outdated and many teams spend an equal amount of time working around the limitations of the infrastructure as they do building solutions to problems for the business they serve. Of course the darling businesses are allowed to buy whatever they need to get the job done, but for the other slow-but-steady money makers, technology can be extremely frustrating. This frustration transcends both the software (compilers, tool kits, etc.) and the hardware (storage subsystems, network infrastructure, etc.). Unless you have deferred comp (difficult to achieve) or are directly involved in a business (QR and trading), your comp is based on the overall performance of the firm and yourself,. but you have no direct way to participate in the gains (or losses) of the firm. A voluntary employee fund (or something along those lines) would be nice for those of us that are dedicated to the firm and want greater benefit from our contributions.\ The office is sterile. There is very little access to natural light (unless you happen to have an office), otherwise it's a fluorescent hell. The ""open cubicle"" concept is extremely detrimental to productivity, but I'm not sure it was done in the name of conformance and collaboration. In reality, it does nothing to foster collaboration outside of what a team is going to do naturally, with the added strikes of being noisy and disruptive. The politics in upper IT management can be paralyzing. We often do nothing out of fear or a Congressional-like inability to compromise, rather than stepping on some toes and doing what's needed to get the job done.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,citadel

Management will promise you bright future/new opportunities to learn, in order to keep you at your assembly point as long as possible, but these promises never fullfilled. A lot of politics. Management think they are so smart and experienced, they don't need any ideas from their subordinates/employees and just manage as they think fit with total disregard/ignorance for good ideas coming from employees. That makes a lot of efforts/new things fail, like their securities business or other efforts in fixed income. No respect for people, it is just a replaceable commodity.

I think this is because upper management makes a mandate to get off the 1st gen stuff but has no plan about what needs to be done to achieve that. - As of spring 2014, software development is being reshuffled, from a system where development was controlled primarily by the desks to a more centralized development.

Shaw & Co. - Investment Firm full-time for more than 8 years,32,* Smart people. * Food surprises. * Nice snacks in the office. * Interesting work. * Good perks.,"* Cut throat atmosphere. It's dog eat dog. Managers and their direct reports are competing for a slice of the same pie. Search for ""I actually never really intended to stay in finance, it was just the only real job I could get with my number theory skills."" using your favorite search engine. * Extremely high pay inequality. Entry quants and developers are making $200-250K while MDs are making $5-10M and the head honcho is making $50-100M. Meanwhile the original founder is raking in $500M+ and doesn't even show up to work any more. * Pay is opaque. You'll get a raise, you won't know why. Your pay will get cut, you won't know why. Bonuses given only annually. * Failure rate of projects is extremely high (90%+). * Nobody here knows how to manage well. You'll be micromanaged until you need to see a shrink. Stifling atmosphere. * All the best people have left owing to the above issues. Some groups have attrition as high as 30% / year. People leaving both from the top and the bottom. * Company's best days are behind it. * Amount of hard work required to be ""successful"" is insane these days. All the low hanging fruit has been eaten. You will have to achieve several Einsteins in a row to make money here. * Your success depends on not only how hard you work, but mostly on which projects get assigned to you. Projects vary widely in their chances of success and their difficulty level. If you get difficult, unlikely to succeed projects, you won't be successful. You will then be perceived as being stupid. This will lead to you not getting good projects in the future. The vicious death spiral will lead to you quitting. The people running the show don't want to understand this because they enjoy their feeling of superiority for having succeeded and being able to call you a stupid failure. * For developers - ancient tech stack. They laugh at the idea of contributing to the open source community. They are insular, outdated, and way behind the times. You will get tired of it quickly. * Laptops only by special request. You'll be chained to an aging Dell desktop machine running an old version of Windows. * Secretive. Little collaboration. Sharing of work and results limited to tiny peer groups (2-5 people). * Slippery recruiting. ""Sell days"" in which you'll be lied to in the face until you join.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,deshaw

Some might appreciate the firm's location just off of Sixth Avenue in midtown Manhattan.","I felt that the picture my interviewers painted of my position was very different from the reality of the position. The firm hires over-qualified people for every position, which means that your position may not be fun or challenging, and moving up is that much more difficult. Fast paced, high stress environment. Health plan had a high deductible. The downside of being organized as a meritocracy is that it takes a long, long time to move anywhere. The company is growing at a very rapid pace, so the average experience of employees at the firm is much lower than it once was. Unless working in a primary business role of the firm, the fact that you are in a supporting position is very clear.",,3.0,3.5,2.5,4.0,4.0,,No opinion of CEO,,,deshaw

Shaw provides a great academic atmosphere where all employees work hard and also have a good work-life balance.,I have been working at D. E. Shaw & Co. - Investment Firm,2,"A few of the best reasons to work for D. E. Shaw are the laid back atmosphere, great benefits and wonderful coworkers. There is no dress code, and only 4 titles in the entire company. While this might seem overwhelming at first, it is nice to not have an emphasis on needing to move up a title every two years. Your career path here can be much more free form and this is reflected in D. E. Shaw's academic nature. Extensive benefits for all employees are a definite perk and everyone who works here tends to be very motivated and smart but also concerned about their lives outside of work. It's definitely a great balance of everything.","Sometimes the academic atmosphere can be a downside. Unless you are the type to figure out what you want to do next and go after it, the opportunity will certainly not come to you like at some more strictly traditional hierarchical companies. The good news is that most of the employees at D. E. Shaw are very smart, enjoy what they do, and know how to go about taking the desired next step in their careers. The senior leadership is very competent and I think the future is bright for the company as a while. While not necessarily considered by me to be a downside, I would recommend that self-moitvated individuals work for the company since I see them as more likely to succeed in this type of an atmosphere.",,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,,Approves of CEO,,,deshaw

It's a very collegial atmosphere where collaboration on both work and extra curriculars (e.g. green initiatives, running club) is encouraged. The company hires interesting people so many people have creative hobbies (everything from writing to acting to stand up comedy) so it's not your typical financial investment firm! The benefits are great -- they include $2/month health insurance, free snacks, subsidized gym memberships, games dispersed around the office (foosball, Wii Guitar Hero, etc...), and great company parties. Work/life balance is generally good and most of the admin jobs are created to appeal to artists from Ivy League schools who need to support their craft with a well paid 9-5 job with a flexible schedule.","Because of the rigorous recruiting policy, it can take months to be hired or hire new employees into your group. The later can cause work overload. Also, some departments have limited opportunities for growth/promotions, but I do feel the selection process is fair. DE Shaw has an open vacation policy, which initially sounds great, but it can make some employees feel guilty about taking vacation days.",,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,,Recommends,,,deshaw

My time there was pretty exceptional--having gone through school at the top of my class, it was a pretty amazing opportunity to be at Five Rings surrounded by people smarter and more knowledgable than me. The staff is a cast of people who were at the top of their class at all of the Northeast's finest universities, and everyone there put tons and tons of effort into teaching me everything they could about all things related to trading and not. The smaller size of the firm and the fact that so much of what people work on impacts everything there definitely makes you feel a lot like the firm is a team where everyone has aligned goals and incentives, unlike a lot of trading firms where people are relatively siloed and only get to think about one problem. As a new hire, I got the opportunity to have tremendous impact and say very quickly in a lot of the firm's important decisions/trading strategies, which is unique--even among similar sized trading firms (I have lots of friends at small prop shops) there are a few layers of bureaucracy separating entry level employees from the people at the top. I sat within 10 feet of the firm's founder from my first day, and any ideas I wanted to share were valued as ideas on their own merit. Disagreement and discussion were encouraged. That's pretty amazing. Everyone at the firm is pretty friendly and open to talking about things, and people have a great sense of humor there. There's catered lunch every day (DOS TOROS DAYS ROCKED) and an awesome pantry. There also was a pretty epic NFL betting pool and an even more epic Secret Santa last year that was really fun. I became/continue to be friends with everyone I worked with there.","Although this doesn't really apply to me, not everyone is cut out to or wants to be a trader (one of the trading assistants hired with me decided to spend almost all his time doing statistical research instead of trading because of his preferences/skillset). The best traders by definition make lots of bad trades, and some people are not good at being willing to make/admitting to mistakes.

I have amazing co-workers. They are top-of-their-class, best-of-breed computer scientists who love improving and helping you improve. We've adopted processes by choice and not enforcement (such as code reviews, testing paradigms, distributed builds, daily releases, etc). Leaders embrace transparency. Every week there is a ""this week in trading"" post that discusses various topics. We've seen topics based on world events, improvements at HRT, postmortems, and so on. Nothing gets swept under the rug; we're better for it. There is no micro management. Discovery of problems (and their solutions) happen organically and cross-team. ""Do the right thing"" and ""make it better"" are seriously embraced mantras. Vacation time is actually yours. It's refreshing to see managers, leaders, co-workers take, encourage, and be encouraged to enjoy their vacation time.","Most positive feedback is implicit. On the other hand negative feedback is actively given. It is difficult to gauge expected performance even with quarterly reviews. It is even harder to figure out how to exceed expectations.

You are working with some of the top minds in the world, collaborating on very difficult problems. I am a trader, so I am constantly scouring the market for opportunities, tweaking our trading systems, and developing tools to help us trade more effectively. There is very little to no administrative work (outside of doing interviews), and a single hour long meeting per week. The people here are incredibly smart, yet humble. Think of it as the very top of the ivy league math and computer science departments, so probably some of the geekiest people you've ever met will be your co-workers. However, not all departments are like that and some are extremely outgoing and charismatic (dating back to the days of floor trading I guess). Everyone is willing to help on just about anything, from the simplest questions to the advanced problems. Few are arrogant, and in fact the company will not hire you if you have an unchecked ego. The pay is really high at the start, even compared to other trading firms. You will have no trouble securing a comfortable apartment in any part of Manhattan on the base salary alone. The bonuses are also high, and they are based on overall performance of the firm. You don't have an individual profit/loss number and never feel that an unlucky stretch will sink your bonus opportunities. The perks are awesome, I won't go into specifics but you receive a very generous package of benefits covering just about everything you could think of. Breakfast and lunch are catered, or you can also have food delivered on the company tab. The kitchen is fully stocked with food, fruit, beverages, snacks, and candy. Jane Street really takes care of its employees. The hours are also quite reasonable for this kind of job. You'll never have set times that you must come in and leave by. I work about 50 hours per week and am about in the middle. Some people work more, some less. There are also very few to no days where you feel that you ""must"" stay late to finish something. You never work weekends or nights. The people are awesome. Everyone works hard while they're here, but nobody gets burned out or has unreasonable expectations. There is practically no hierarchy at all, and little to no busy work. Finally, the firm has very high ethical standards. We will intentionally avoid strategies that, while legal, are ethically in a gray area. I've yet to run into anything truly illegal happen at this place.","The only weird downside is eating lunch at your desk. Traders don't get up from their desk more than a few times a day, and never for longer than to grab food or use the bathroom.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,jane_street

The traders are smart and the way they tackle difficult analysis makes for an interesting mentoring experience. People are very friendly (save tense times during market hours) and help is always given upon request. The projects were difficult because they were very open ended, therefore the self imposed pressure to create meaningful analysis was immense. It was cool to see what other interns came up with, approaches varied wildly. Hours are decent, no pressure to stay late from the firm but (as mentioned before) the pressure to achieve something meaningful with the difficult studies sometimes meant staying in late by choice. In fact we were encouraged to make the most of Chicago rather than stay in and work late, very uplifting to see them care about work-life balance. However, most of the best learning experiences came from spending these hours talking to traders who also stayed late. The firm is very young in general and the culture is a great mix of work hard, play hard. There were many weekends when the traders were more than happy to include us in social events and outings (bars, fests, and other awesome night life). There was an abundance of official events and outings as well all of which made the internship a lot more fun.","Formal instruction was limited to the classes, which were well taught but limited in scope. As a result the projects felt like enormous tasks with little sense of ""correctness"" and I felt the need to overthink almost every step I took. Not enough scheduled trader-intern interaction. The latter portion of the internship included sitting at the desks as the traders trade. The value I see in this experience is not proportional to the number of weeks allotted to it.

Every year it gets better. - The company is managed on the basis of principles and values, not process or politics. - Those principles and values align very nicely with mine: -- Autonomy: there is very little hand-holding and extraordinarily high expectations of individuals in the company. The company rewards those that keep pushing those expectations higher with greater responsibility and authority. -- Collaboration: there are a lot of great fights over the right way to approach a given problem. When we're at our best, everyone in the fight has a strong opinion but is also listening to everyone else and continually re-evaluating that opinion as new information, ideas, and opinions are expressed. -- Prudence: the company carefully evaluates risk/reward trade-offs both when it comes to trading and technology decisions. The latest fads (cryptocurrency, esoteric programming languages, etc) are carefully evaluated, but reckless pursuit of them is frowned upon. I'll end with a sports analogy. Working at Optiver Chicago is like playing for the Patriots or the San Antonio Spurs. It certainly isn't for everyone. But if you like competing for the championship every year and always pushing yourself to be better, there's no better team to join.","If the company values do not align with yours, you will find it an increasingly frustrating place to work.

They will not hesitate to cut you if you can't keep up with management's standards. A sizable portion of your compensation is determined by your individual performance, where the standards of judgement can be unclear. Management, who is responsible for this, clearly plays favorites (usually the top performers, but not necessarily). They are also very unforgiving when you make mistakes or need help to get something done. The management claims there is no stack ranking, but you're performance will be measured up against your peers come review time. Not much meaning behind your hard work other than making more $$ if you care about that sort of thing, so you will need to find motivation elsewhere. Guess it comes with the territory. I've seen certain members of management lash out and/or demean certain employees. Abysmal profit sharing/bonus scheme relative to other firms in the industry, especially for dev roles. Skews very heavily towards the top who's contributions are not clear. That being said, pay is still great for junior and senior employees alike.

Although salary is on the low side, with traders earning 85k USD regardless of seniority, bonuses can be high. When the company is doing well, a rookie can expect a bonus that is at least the same as annual salary, and the next promotion level can expect a bonus that is four times the rookie's. Rookies are generally promoted after 2 years. The work environment is comfortable. Casual dress means some traders wear shorts and flip-flops year-round. Lunch is catered daily, and snacks are provided in the kitchen.","Optiver has done a good job in recent years with its on-campus marketing (e.g., ""We improve the market"", ""Brilliantly different"", ""Collaboration and transparency"", etc.). However, there is an inconsistency between the company message and the reality for many of its employees. Optiver is no longer a small, tight-knit shop; it is a corporation. If given a choice between sticking to principles and maximizing shareholder value, Optiver will choose the latter. Employees have seen this time and again, with team members forced to leave under questionable, often politically-motivated circumstances. Optiver is a great short-term play. It's a good place to start your trading career. My advice is to learn as much as you can, but always be prepared to leave and join another company for the long-term.

Here are some points that highlight this: - Superb perks/benefits and compensation. Bonuses have been consistently high for the past few years, and are only going up. There will be plenty of 7 figure bonuses this year. - You can move up very quickly. It should only take you a few years to reach the highest trader level if you are doing well. - Unlike so many other trading firms, profits are shared, forming the foundation of the teamwork-oriented culture. There is a natural incentive for information sharing and collaboration, ""all you have to do is ask."" Everyone wants to see others succeed because we all want to see the pie get bigger. - Plenty of autonomy. Good traders learn to become good entrepreneurs, pursuing success through the projects they choose. As long as you can support your ideas (over competing ideas) with logic and data, you will be able to get the resources to execute them. - Excellent work-life balance. Most traders are here from 700AM-530PM.

Sat Oct 03 2015 12:10:28 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Software Developer,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,A Principled Trading Company,I have been working at Optiver full-time for more than 5 years,7,"- Mission: We have a clear directive: Improve the market. I love the focus that mission brings in combination with its moral undertones. We only pursue strategies which actually add value to the world’s financial markets. And I see this play out every week as well. In meetings questions like “why should we be paid to this”, “is this a fair strategy”, and “is this money we should leave on the table” are constantly asked. It is so refreshing to work for a trading company which takes it duty to ensure stable, fair, transparent markets seriously. - Teamwork: The camaraderie, sense of togetherness, and practical outworking of the company structure are incredible. Within our office in Chicago, it feels like everyone is part of a tight-knit team that works together as true partners with no second-class citizens. Between offices there is a wonderful sense of friendly competition (every office wants the best results) balanced by the knowledge that we all share in each other’s success which motivates everyone to constantly sharing technology, strategies, and learnings. - Humility: Why are the most successful people at Optiver successful? Speaking for IT, the key is humility, being self-critical, proactively looking for critiques and advice to help yourself improve, and looking for your own faults before others. Our most senior people are the first ones to take the blame for something going wrong and push those around them to help learn from those mistakes and grow. - Intelligence: You can’t be a great company in this industry without incredibly smart people. And in addition to being some of the most humble, hardworking people I know, my colleagues are also incredibly smart. If we were ever to decide “let’s cut the person with the lowest IQ”, I’d need to start looking for a job… Thankfully I know we’ll never do that. :-)","- Professionalism Training: Because most new hires are fresh out of school, there is a need for and lack of training in “professionalism”: How to make a business case. How to produce meaningful statistics and not gibberish. How do you create, plan, and run a meeting. How do you stay organized and not drop the ball? How should you behave in a meeting? Etc. That many new hires don’t know these things is not a problem. The issue is the lack of internal development and mentoring in these areas. - Focus: Optiver has a lot of intelligent people, high quality traders, and opportunities to grow. But it feels like we’re at a giant buffet where every food option looks incredible. We’re half-way through the line, and we have a full plate and a choice: do we grab a second plate and keep moving or step back and re-evaluate what is best for our long-term health and short-term digestion? It often feels like we go for the second plate when we should ask: is that chocolate pie really going to be that good? We’ve tried it three times before and never been satisfied. Why do we think it will be good this time?",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,optiver

The bonuses are great compared to non-finance development jobs. However as a developer you are miles behind the traders in terms of bonuses, so be prepared to be working with youngsters that are on a multiple of your income. One of the great benefits is that there are no external customers, you are only developing solutions for internal use. This has some great upsides - you only work on projects that are really needed and make an immediate difference to the company. You can see your code go straight into production and directly interact with the users to get feedback. The work/life balance is extremely good compared to previous jobs I have had, you aren't really expected to do extra except to be on standby for external dependencies such as exchange upgrades. Usually the internal work is planned well in advance. The company does have a strong moral(!) compass in terms of trading behavior. We try to compete in a fair way with other market participants and although the phrase 'improve the market' is parroted a lot as a mission statement, I do think it is generally true (while trying to make money of course). There is also the cliche of getting to work with a lot of smart people, in this case it is definitely true.","If you have no interest in trading then you are not going to progress. Think of it is a trading company that also happens to do development. There is always more work than people and a lot of technical debt. There are so many products and markets we are trying to support that it's almost impossible to keep track of. Although the bonus scheme is open and visible, the shares scheme is completely opaque. There is relatively high staff turnover in all departments. The process isn't completely visible but if the company decides one day that they don't want you then they make you an offer to incentivize you to leave. Sometimes people disappear without a word and you wonder what happened because they seemed competent enough. The bonus structure has extremely coarse resolution, it doubles at each level so it makes an enormous difference to overall remuneration. It is not at all clear what the requirements for these levels are, it is completely at the discretion of your direct manager if you progress. The CTO position has been extremely unstable, the tech leadership at this level is constantly in flux. The team leads have been fairly stable despite this though. There is definitely a Dutch bias in the management positions, while progression generally seems to be based on merit, this is an exception.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,optiver

Colleagues are very smart people and the atmosphere is culturally rich.

There's a bit of a herd approach in designing systems and applications, and straying from the path is frowned upon even when the advantages of doing so are clear or might be worth a shot.

Things that have stand out to me are: -Well structured training program when you join run by a dedicated trader trainer. -Given a lot of responsibility as soon as you join a desk- Around 4 months in the job. You get paired with experienced trader(s) who will mentor you. -You will learn from some of the best in the industry. There's a reason Optiver has such consistently strong performances year on year. For example, 2017 was one of Optiver's best years- a year where most market makers struggled to turn a profit due to very low volatility. -Minimal hierarchy. If you have good ideas there's very little holding you back from executing. -Get to work on challenging quantitative problems that have a fast turn around time to see the results. -The mission statement of ""We improve the market"" is taken very seriously and means a lot to me. Practically this means we spend a lot of time trying to provide liquidity where it's actually needed (particularly in options and ETFs), help exchanges improve regulations to make them safer (think better error trade rules) etc.","Although the hours are reasonable by professional standards (10 hour days, no weekends), the work is intense. At Optiver you will be challenged to achieve beyond what you think is possible. I don't see this as a con because I find the work really enjoyable and stimulating. However if you aren't able to keep up or aren't passionate about working on these sort of problems, it will be not be fun.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,optiver

Optiver nowadays sets the standard in many of the markets in which they are active. In my opinion a lot of the competitors lack a vision beyond trying to copy what Optiver does. Optiver has a flat corporate structure which allows traders to get a lot of responsibility right from the start. This offers great upside potential for people who are hard working and eager to learn as supposed to a career in a more corporate environment such as an investment bank. Desks are setup as teams which promotes knowledge exchange and cameraderie. Transfers between offices is something which is actively promoted by management. It offers you the opportunity to grow both on a career and personal level.,"Long hours which are (unfortunately) an industry standard.

We were very lucky to have such an awesome team who pulled together some of the best company events I've ever been to, and they do it with the intent to 'thank' the employees who make Optiver a great place to work. - There's no budget on development, which means you are encouraged to pursue further study or attend workshops and conferences. - Food! The chefs and their team are incredible. They get to know each of you and try their best to cater for everyone's needs. Level 7 is never short of awesome snacks and nutritious options.","- There's not a lot of career development within the organisation and this is purely based on the flat structure.

Tue Apr 10 2018 10:31:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,,Former Employee ,Hectic workplace with no tech culture,I worked at Optiver full-time,4,"Some decent perks: on-site barista, weekly chair massage, 30 vacation days. Lunch is cheap (not free) and most of the time it’s ok, but the choice is very limited. Sometimes you’ll only get something deep fried or a burger. The annoying thing is that they also limit the amount of food people can take, sometimes there’ll be a sign saying ‘1 piece per person’. The pay is decent for Dutch standards but not quite top-notch if you consider working in other countries and not just the Netherlands. Even in NL the compensation is already lagging behind the competition. A bonus is a big part of the compensation and can be taken away for any reason. There are still some pretty smart people working there, although more and more leave the company.","The company is constantly and deliberately understaffed. Even though your pay may be not the worst, as a software developer you’ll be doing at least a 3-person job - you’ll be a developer, project manager, and user support specialist. There’s pretty much no planning, things are done in a hectic way, it’s often unclear what needs to be done to move forward with a task/project. Optiver is a noisy and distracting workplace, it’s considered ok to have loud conversations when others around are trying to concentrate. There’re very limited options to work from home or away from desk, you won’t get a laptop or decent phone. While I worked there, there was a major reconstruction of the office being done, both outdoors and indoors. During that time sometimes it was virtually impossible to concentrate - there was loud sound of drilling, toxic smell of paint or burned plastic, extremely low temperatures during winter, even workers listening to radio during office hours... The company didn’t do anything to minimize these inconveniences, probably breaking quite a few workplace laws in the meantime. The technology stack they use is very limited and outdated. There’s no room for trying out new things in tech; they constantly emphasise that they’re a trading, not a tech company, and technology is just a tool to accomplish the business needs. They have pretty much non-existent IT support, you have to figure all out by yourself and the developer machine setup is very inconvenient. Projects in some teams can be interesting if you’re lucky but there’s also a lot of work done due to regulatory requirements or for ‘political’ reasons. The company is very hierarchical, even though it’s advertised as having a flat structure. The teams, instead of cooperating, often are very competitive against each other; between different offices (e.g. Amsterdam and Sydney) there is pretty much no cooperation at all. They are quite obviously favorizing Dutch employees; even though the Dutch comprise quite a bit less that 50% of the staff in Amsterdam, somehow the vast majority of team leadership/managerial positions are given to the Dutch. Overall, maybe it’s not the worst place to work and you can definitely make an impact there, but all the cons are just too much to make you want to stay there.",,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No opinion of CEO,optiver

Below market rate base salary ('compensated' by a discretionary profit sharing scheme that can be taken away at any time). Upper management is opaque, and decision making by middle management often appears to be motivated by what's best for their careers rather than what's best for the company or their team. The level of ego among many of the technical specialists can be extreme at times. They're the best of the best - and they're not humble about it. Personal performance appraisal is directly linked to compensation. Which sounds great in theory, but the performance appraisal process is opaque.

A closer look shows that many of Optiver's claims stretch the truth and some are outright falsehoods. For instance, Optiver calls itself a ""Great Place to Work"", no doubt referring to its performance in the Best Places to Work in Australia survey, in which it achieved 2nd place in 2014. What Optiver neglects to mention is its paltry performance in recent years within the same survey, with placements of 3rd and 6th in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, in fact, Optiver failed to make the list entirely (25 total spots). It is concerning that an organisation that supposedly champions truth and merit invests so heavily in building its image. I suggest looking to third-party sources for verification -- Glassdoor's own Rating Trends is a good place to start. The truth is that Optiver Australia, which trades the Asian markets, has not been doing well. Following the exchange upgrades in Japan, which have made the exchange more deterministic (think winner takes all), Optiver has no longer been able to get as many trades as it shoots for. Mind you, Nikkei and Topix were once significant income streams. Add to the picture changes in Hong Kong regulations pertaining to Stamp Duty (think trading fees) that has forced Optiver to close its corresponding basket versus ETF desk, also a big money maker in the past. Take my advice, if you are choosing between Optiver and a competitor, go with the latter.

They do a great job of supporting local businesses with the catering and are getting better about having women’s programming. Although it’s not necessarily a diverse environment (especially in technology or on the trading floor), it’s a very welcoming and inclusive environment. I think the difficulty with SIG is just really based on where you came from. If previously you worked somewhere with lots of hierarchy and titles and rigidity, SIG can be overwhelming in how relaxed and informal it can be. Other places might say they dress casual, but SIG actually means it. Yes people do actually wear shorts in the summer to work. If you are used to a micromanaged atmosphere, SIG can definitely take a while to get used to. I’m definitely very independent, but I have found for the most part people let you figure out the best pace for you to get your work down...and at first, this was scary.

I worked at SIG in the Technology space for almost twenty-three years. During that time, I worked with great people, worked on the latest technology and witnessed incredible growth. SIG’s biggest asset are its people. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people during my time there. People that are smart, hard-working, team oriented and respectful. I believe SIG strives to hire people with all of those qualities with equal emphasis on ALL of them. As a result, it promotes an environment of constant learning, challenges and success. It is not big leap to think that Technology plays a big role in most companies. It is the same at SIG but the difference being, SIG constantly assesses latest technology and if any of it can provide a competitive advantage, SIG will leverage it no matter how new it may be. They are in the business of assessing risk and that includes the use of technology. For a technologist this is the best type environment to learn, grow and be successful. As far as growth is concerned, over the last 23 years, I have seen SIG grow from 4 offices to 14 including international offices in Sydney, Dublin, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The bottom line is it did not stop growing the entire time I was there and there was no indication it was going to stop anytime soon. I could close this review with a pros and cons list but I think that can be read in other reviews. Some I would agree with and some I would not. One pro that I will always give SIG big kudos is in the area of benefits. They provided adoption assistance benefits 20 years ago during a time when it was not very common. I may be a bit biased but if this is the thought that always comes to mind after being at a company for over twenty years that speaks volumes about that company. It is a great company with great people, using great technology to fuel incredible growth. I think nothing more needs to be said.",All jobs and companies have their challenges.

Recession-proof company. Decent bonuses. Some sections much better than others.,"I worked for this company for 10 years and had some horrible experiences. Some people are impressed by the free breakfast and lunch but this just means the company gets another hour of work out of you in a mandatory 45 hour + week. The interview process is brutal and you often don't hear the results. The company is very conscious about paying as little as possible by way of salaries and using whatever leverage they can against you. For example a friend of mine was there for five years and never got a raise because her husband was undergoing cancer treatment and they knew she could not leave and lose the health insurance. During the 2008 crisis they told everyone there would be no raises and bonuses because the company had done poorly. In 2009 they told everyone that they would be no raises or bonuses because despite the fact that the company did extremely well, the market was tight and they were lucky to have jobs and they could replace all the employees easily. It wasn't until the market turned around and people began to leave that the company panicked and began giving raises again and asking what else they could do to make employees stay. They are happy to take advantage of employees situation when it suits them and then complain when employees are not loyal. Certain groups are much better than others and certain managers are excellent While others are terrible. The programmers and developers in the technology and are treated extremely well. The Enterprise Services Group was treated very poorly and managed very poorly. Lots of incompetence and Empire Building and many broken promises. Management takes care of other managers even when they're incompetent or even abusive while employees are expendable. They promised training and education but whenever you applied for it suddenly there wasn't time in the schedule for it. They would tell you that education was part of your compensation package but it was next to impossible to get any training. I personally took on a project that was supposed to have several other people on it, and yet when these other people were removed from the project I was expected to meet the deadlines unchanged without the resources. In fact I ended up having to buy some software on my own out of pocket to finish the project. I even put off my vacation to the next year to finish the project on time after being assured that I would be able to take my vacation the next year. When the project was done the following year my position was eliminated and I was let go after 10 years of service and was not paid for my 5 weeks of vacation untaken nor was I given any severance. Susquehanna has a staff of excellent lawyers and they're pretty sure that you won't sue them unless you are in management. Managers get excellent Severance packages. Don't get me wrong there's some good groups to work for and you can learn a lot although advancement is extremely Limited. They have a tendency to hire Traders &amp; quants in large numbers and then after a year firing the low performers.

There are exceptions in certain cases, and this is changing a bit, but slowly compared to other tech-heavy companies. * The management structure is fairly flat. However, this also impacts the ability to get things done. You really do need to build consensus across many teams to get major initiatives done, and this will take time. * Hours can get long and impact the work-life balance, especially with the lack of work from home policy.

Hands down the BEST training program in the securities industry. For tech and business. Very well thought out courses. Fresh grads should definitely come here to work for a few years, even if taking a pay cut. Especially if the securities industry is your focus. Overall very well structured compare to other hedge funds or prop shops. Lot's of documentations for everything. Everything is very well planned out for new comers to pick things up quickly. Decent compensation for the Philly area. Tons of talented people and hard workers. I think almost everyone SIG is giving all they got but some are just more talented than others. Free food and snacks. Some cool outside activities during the year. Management tries not to point fingers when human error occurs but actually tries to come up with solutions on how to fix them. This is really a rare trait and is highly undervalued. Everyone is really trying, some just tries harder.","Compensation not really competitive on national market. Growth and mobility is hard because how well defined the company structure is. This is really a double edged sword. Everything is very well defined and breaking barriers is hard. I'd say it's good for the company over all but it kinda screws people over that's been doing the same job for many years without an option for growth. Yearly raises are terrible. You really need to hammer down you initial offer because expecting decent growth isn't going to happen. Yes some managers are just clocking it in and out, but that's not the majority. If you get one of those then I feel sorry for you. Some old tech still in play but a lot of people are working on phasing it out. Too many production freezes and sign offs for changes. They are there for good reasons but some are just offensive. It's like they think we graduated yesterday. I'd say half of all the freezes are completely worthless. Some luck does come into play for progression within the company. Depending on what work your manager assigns you, you might be an all star. Seen some people write some pretty impressive and important things, and some people just got lucky to write the important things. And those are usually turds. Documentation is everywhere and is core to the culture. Switch is also a double edged sword because it makes everyone replaceable.

The idea that SIG will leverage its Options expertise to build a strong institutional equities business has been unsuccessful as most equity investors do not care to understand derivatives (and vice versa). Senior Analysts and salespeople are generally comprised of has-beens and never-will-be’s, which is par for the course at most small boutique operations. Leadership is the real concern, as the defacto head of the institutional brokerage operation is a SIG-lifer with little brokerage experience, employing self-serving sycophantic department heads beneath him. Sales tends to rule over the Research Department with little regard or understanding of the Research process (scheduling firm-wide meetings and other important events during earnings season). Salespeople are loathe to make outgoing calls, save for one or two, and are typically interested in heading to the bar by 4:05pm. The Director of Research is a former salesperson who embodies the company’s lack of understanding of how to run a research business. This individual lacks research experience (and the respect of many senior analysts and associates), making up for that with canned speeches about the bright future of the business. Nearly 25% of the company’s Senior Research Analysts defected to competing organizations in the past year as the business continues to shrink under current leadership. The firm has make some questionable hires to replace departed analysts, including individuals who have been out of Equity Research for more than 3-4 years.

Mon Jul 11 2016 13:33:10 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Trader,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",Former Employee ,"Sterile, nerdy, masculine energy",I worked at Susquehanna International Group (SIG) full-time for more than a year,33,They know how to trade well and are good at rational thinking. The Assistant Trader internship might be the best internship in America. The poker culture is also solid even though the founders and higher ups (not talking about BC/JA) think about the game the way one would in the early 2000's and not the mid 2010's.,"No diversity: almost all of the decision-making is done by white males. Only women they visibly hire are in HR – they will do their best to include the few minorities/women that they do hire in every recruiting picture possible. (Look for repeating faces it's hilarious) They will brag about their education department but it really isn't that incredible. Any real trader you ask will tell you how everything you'll learn about trading happens on the floor, talking to other practicing traders. There is one sharp fellow who was in education when I left, and I'm not sure why he isn't on the floor instead. The other two clowns up there are a soccer mom and a pompous neanderthal There's another issue that at least applies to incoming Assistant Traders, which is: at every point in your lifetime at SIG, you will be ""priced in"" to continue to the next level. At no point do you ever think it's a ""rational"" decision to stop working there. For starters, they pay interns more than anyone else, and give the best intern experience possible. This sells you on the idea of becoming an AT. Then you're an AT and grind pretty hard to make trading class, so how could you possibly leave SIG after you make it to that? In doing so, you sign a non-compete and lock yourself into a non-competitive salary (for trading) for the next 3 years. You've committed to living in Philadelphia for the next 1000 days, with the promise of cashing in on the first year after the non-compete. Then after you think your payday has arrived, they shoot you a lowball offer since they are well-aware you already have a stable girlfriend/maybe wife, are planning to have kids, already call Philadelphia ""home"", etc. At every stage of your relationship with this company, they are so deliberately thinking about how to extract maximum value out of their employees. There's no upward mobility any more. They've got everything in place, and it's REALLY tough to move up. If it were 2000 I would say you should definitely go work at SIG for this reason. No more, now they're just looking for cogs to make the system run smoothly. Then there are the minor things. It's a company worth 11 figures, yet the office decor is bland and there's no color/art/character to the place at all. The food is repetitive and outside of the salad bar, pretty unappetizing and unhealthy. Overall, if you are in SIG's hiring set (white/asian male who is good at math and has some common sense), you should either work: – at a smaller trading firm with people who have better taste (you'll work longer hours for more reward), OR – at a larger tech company like an Uber or Facebook, where it's still homogenous but at least you'll have laxer hours & good food, can live in a better city, and there's a bit more upward mobility, OR – grind it out at a small startup where you aren't drawing dead to win big, even though the hours will be rougher",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,sig

Recession proof. Some pockets of great people in what was Enterprise Technology. Enterprise Services on the other hand is a snake pit. Lots of opportunity to learn on your own. Not so big on training. Great parties. People say the free food but you are supposed to work through lunch. People who went outside to walk around the parking lot for air and sunshine were told that looked unprofessional. It is fun to watch the helicopter land and take off from the pad.,"I worked here for ten years and watched clear favoritism with some employees allowed to skate through their job based on if a manager liked them or if they were attractive. Saw many hard working individuals treated poorly. People with tremendous results and reviews year after year kicked out when managers changed. At least they take very good care of management when letting them go, they get good packages. Regular employees? Often let go with no severance, and, due to a quirk in their system, if you have vacation unused or carried over from the previous year? You lose it all. That's right. Five year, no severance, no vacation pay, please leave right now. THey have a dark culture in some areas, ruling by fear and intimidation. Reminding you at all times that they can replace you and you are lucky to have a job. They did that during the 2008-2010 dip. No raises and no bonuses in some cases...as they explained...we do not have to give you raises just because a year has passed. THe market for jobs is tight. So we have the upper hand. So...no raises. Some people went five years without a raise. Then when things got better they were shocked, shocked I say, when some of the best talent left. I watched people work 60+ hour weeks out of fear that less would lead them to be fired. I watched middle managers groomed by their abusive bosses to pass that abuse down the chain. Fear and intimidation. Sad. Again, not in Enterprise Technology, while that existed, but in Enterprise Services.

Very few people move up instead of out (although some of that comes with any trading job). There is some of the usual bureaucratic inflexibility that comes with being a 1500-person company.

Fri Jan 31 2014 11:54:14 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Technology Manager,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",Current Employee ,The Crown Jewel of Wall Street,I have been working at Susquehanna International Group (SIG) full-time for more than 10 years,14,"Excellent culture. Very anti-corporate. The focus here is not about the titles, policies, micromanagement, politics, bureaucracy and layoffs when the P&L takes a hit which is what I experienced at other financial firms. It’s about collaboration, teaming, decision making, innovation, delivery and empowering people to be the best they can be to contribute to SIG’s success. I faced culture shock when I arrived at SIG but easily adapted once I realized how this culture contributes to SIG’s overall success and individual and team success. I’ll take this culture along with the jeans and sneakers and shorts in the summer over the suit and tie and wing tipped shoes I trashed years ago. I consider the managing directors to be approachable, friendly and fun, and passionate about their employees and company success. I also consider them to be some of the top risk managers on Wall Street. Their proven track record in trading and approach to running the company gives me confidence and comfort that we are part of a winning team especially when facing tough financial markets. We have very friendly, intelligent, skilled hard working employees committed to the success of the organization with the willingness to educate and help each other. Traders and Technologists are united partners that shape our overall Trading business. Employees have the opportunity to grow and have greater impact along the way if they are determined and committed to do so. Open communication and idea sharing is encouraged not discouraged. Fairly flat organization structure which contributes to the lack of politics and bureaucracy. As such, decisions are made very quickly and people are more productive. The Technology team is led by a CIO who is committed to ensuring that her team is core to the success of the business by delivering innovative solutions that give our business an edge on their competition. The team is unified, committed to innovation and delivering cutting edge and bleeding edge technologies to our trading business. This fosters an exciting, challenging and rewarding environment for technologists. Micromanagement is non-existent but exposure to all levels within the organization is the norm. We are focused on overcoming challenges and making the impossible possible. These are things I didn’t experience at previous employers. The workload is generally heavy and consistent across the Technology organization. This is why prioritization is a key area of focus. If you are looking for a 9 to 5 job with many breaks throughout the day then this is not be the place for you. If you are a highly motivated technologist looking to be challenged and busy and working with complex technologies then SIG could be the right place for you. I’ve seen a significant commitment to the evolution of our education programs such as co-operative and internship programs and our Technology Associates program. I’ve seen each produce opportunities for recent grads to join SIG full time and have successful careers over the years. These are a few examples of the many channels used to attract and hire top talent. Benefits and perks are good. Free breakfast/lunch is one of the better perks. In addition to being free, I don’t have to contend with traffic and lines at local food establishments wasting time. This allows me to get back to work faster. After working for other financial firms, I consider SIG to be the crown jewel of Wall Street. Among other things, the owners, people, culture, team approach and my ability to innovate and have impact is what keeps me at SIG. To me, this is the place to be if you if you want a challenging and rewarding career as a technologist at a financial firm.",The grass is not always greener but in most cases it’s much greener than any of the other Wall Street financial firms I worked at during my career. That along with my consistent losing streak at the annual poker tournament and in any of the many sweepstakes that take place at SIG throughout the year are the only cons that come to mind.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,sig

You are presented with unique situations, difficult situations, and often have to move quickly. The technology organization actually keeps up with the times pretty well, you aren't using ancient programming technology or outdated hardware. The work culture is friendly and open. Engineers are given a lot of flexibility to solve problems the way they think is best. Very good fringe benefits like free food, gym, and on site hair cuts. Salary is very competitive for the area. The other engineers are generally pretty smart, and pretty willing to work as a team. In many other companies, different groups within a company form ""cliques"" that are often adversarial - not that way at SIG at all. Groups work together towards common goals and are very willing to help each other. I find this rare, and actually pretty awesome as an engineer.","-The work environment is not ideal if you're in the trading floor. If you're a software engineer that's used to an office, or even a cubicle, you're in for a rude awakening. It's noisy and there's no privacy. -Strict hours can be a pain. It's the nature of finance, but being expected to be in the building from 8-5 is irritating at times. Life happens. They're understanding of exceptions, but it goes against the company culture. -Similarly, they don't believe in remote work / telecommuting, which makes no sense for technology -I'll be blunt - the benefits stink. Health care is very expensive, and the 401k program is severely lacking. They only give their match in a lump sum the following year, and it takes 4 years to vest.

This is great because you get real-time user feedback and get to see first-hand the impact your work is having. - Very little bureaucracy or politics, especially for a company this size. Working at SIG often feels like working in a small company, but with access to the resources of a large firm. - The pay is very competitive compared to other companies in the area. There are also lots of perks like the often-mentioned free breakfast and lunch, a full gym, exercise classes, on-site car wash services, and they are adding charging stations if you have an electric vehicle. - The culture here is EXCELLENT. The people who work here are generally very happy and the low turnover rate we have is a testament to that. - SIG has a very flat structure which I think helps foster the collegiate environment that is present here. On multiple occasions, I have gone to technologists (or business people) on other teams for help and have never been turned away, even when I was new to the company and the industry. - You won't see your good idea ignored in favor of a lesser idea by a ""Senior"" developer here, like I've seen happen at so many other development shops. Management really does foster an environment that allows the best idea to win.","Since SIG is a private partnership, company financials are not public information and the employees are often in the dark about how the company is performing as a whole.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,sig

Teams collaborate heavily, but I rarely saw any managers step up to bat for their teams or open their mouths when a process could be improved or work being done was redundant. Status quo is the name of the game here, so don't expect to be given any opportunity to advance, simplify processes, or to have your input be valued. There are also multiple systems for doing nearly everything in technology. Want to get system access to a Server A? Request it through Webpage A. Want to get access to server B? Email Team B. There is so much wasted time with half completed projects and systems that barely do their intended function. Overall, I saw these problems pervading through the entire Bala Cynwyd office.

Each team is able to solve problems as they see fit (of course in a manner that integrates with other teams). We have Oracle, Sql Server, MySql, C#, C++, Perl, Ruby, Python, Linux, WIndows, Access, Multicast, Web farms, VM farms. if it works and makes sense and can make money... go for it. Perfect mix of ""down to earth"" people, who are also the smartest you will work with in one place. Big enough to be involved in all aspects of Wall Street and advanced technologies, but teams are small enough that no one developer feels lost in huge projects. The business is incredibly accessible. Questions on option trading, how an app should function, just go and talk to the key business people. Not only will they help you, they will respect you for taking the time to engage them. 3 weeks vacation to start. plus personal days. Plus unlimited sick days. It doesnt take 3 years to complete every project! People are geared to make things happen. At many levels technologists are catered to as the business recognizes the value they bring. Currently all developers moving to Quad Core Win 7 64 bit machines. Ya want it, request it, you got it. You dont need 1000 levels of approvals. ""I need 4 monitors because.."" and 2 days later the monitors show up. FREE LUNCH! Actually, breakfast too! Key aspect... the entrepreneurial spirit carries into technology. In just my short 5 years there I have seen many new university hires quickly gain new positions, or moved into advanced system development. If you can do the job the opportunities arent there VERY competitive salaries for the Philadelphia Market place. Not as high as New York, but higher than the majority of Philadelphia technology firms. Technologists PARTNER with the business. Many times the business gives general ideas ""We'd like to start trading _____ "" and tech is sort've like industry experts to say ""how about this... did you consider this... how about we do this first, then move on to....""","The same entrepreneurial spirit and autonomy can sometimes lead to frustration in getting dependent teams on the same page and schedule. A problem everywhere, but SIG moves through it with common sense. For those that want a structured promotion plan, SIG could be frustrating, There isnt a mult- level structure of ""You did good this year so now you are Computer Scientist Level III"". If you want that, go to Computer Science corporation. If you are kicking butt, you'll see it in your paycheck. If you want to be told what to do all the time... SIG isnt for you. Requirements aren't always solid. Business doesn't always know what they want. Technologists are expected to know technology AND the business. Many time (most) times technologists have to drive requirements and considerations. Techies who love this process do well SIG. You want to be handed a contractual like requirements document, look elsewhere. Mixed into the amazing technologies, are processes and applications that were put together quickly to meet an immediate need.

Where as a lot of companies say they run like a startup and have a meritocracy, SIG actually for the most part adhere's to this policy closely and is reflected from most of the managers down to the rank and file employees. There are a lot of different groups - even with technology, within SIG. Once you are here, there's a lot of potential to transition laterally if you find a particular interest (Market data, security, server-side, client-side, database..etc) and if you want to work close to the desk/traders, you generally can get that opportunity working for most of the groups here. The employee review structure is fair and a lot of attention is paid to compensation and performance review. Star performers are rewarded based on their contributions and it is possible to come here, do a great job, and reap the benefits - however, there is a limited upside as a technology employee here. The lions share of the bonuses goes towards traders and head traders here.","The counter-point to the relative flat structure and merit-based culture is, with the growth that they have been experiencing, especially in technology, the employee structure can feel a little hierarchical in the end and what you do can increasingly feel pigeon-holed. There's a lot of initiatives going on, a lot of projects flowing, but it's easy to increasingly feel like a cog in the wheel without actively going out and ask people from other departments are doing. If you are just starting out, especially in financial/trading industry, you might be better served working for a startup or boutique just to get the opportunity to do a little bit of everything and carve out a niche for yourself. To prevent yourself from settling into a cycle of overspecialization or monotony here, you definitely have to be mindful of actively asking for new projects and growth opportunities. There are some internal competition here as well, from each trading/technology group, as well as internal competition among workers in a particular group. The best technology people within software develop usually get new development projects and architectural leeway, whereas the middle of the pack and lower end performers get stuck supporting legacy systems. To some people, doing support and incremental fixes to existing systems is a safe and stressful job and they are okay with it. If you are particularly interested in writing performance intensive code or novel low level system code, you should specify that and try to get out of legacy support duties as soon as possible.",,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,Recommends,,Approves of CEO,sig

Sun Jul 22 2018 01:30:33 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,"Dublin, Dublin",Former Employee ,"Ops – Great Place to Work, Learn and Develop – It is what you make of it.",I worked at Susquehanna International Group (SIG) full-time for more than 5 years,7,"Working in SIG’s Dublin Operations department was a positive and rewarding experience in many ways. The many pros outweigh the few cons and I would highly recommend SIG as a place to work. The working environment: SIG’s culture promotes a relaxed and open working environment where people are actively encouraged to interact. As a result, people can easily get to know one another on both a professional and personal level. The office is full of talented and knowledgeable people, many of whom are experts in their respective fields, and who are overwhelmingly friendly and approachable. An open plan office, genuinely friendly employees and a management team that openly encourages cross team and departmental interaction results in a very collaborative work place. This collaboration is supported by a shared understanding that working together will develop a stronger business and result in better outcomes for all. There is also the reality that with so many intelligent people in the office, working alone and producing sub-optimal outcomes will likely become very apparent very quickly. Trading Exposure: Operations directly support the day-to-day trading of the firm giving workers a great insight into the world of trading. Many operation teams sit alongside traders and work with them on everything from day-to-day trade flow management, to projects that can enhance trader’s tools to free up their time, to developing business opportunities in new financial products and markets. Operations in SIG is not like your traditional operations department found in Dublin. It offers true exposure to the front office. Proximity to trading often results in a faced paced and an exciting environment. Management Style: Management’s well communicated approach is to hire motivated, hardworking and smart individuals who can drive the business forward and not simply just do a job. People are empowered with the freedom to make their own decisions and take direct responsibility of their work. Innovation and initiative are encouraged, if you spot something that can be improved, management do not stand in your way in implementing positive change so long as you continue to perform your day-to-day responsibilities. In all, they provide people with a platform to prove their ability. Recognition and rewards for hard work often come in the form of enhanced responsibility and learning opportunities through taking ownership of new areas and tasks. When performing your job as expected, management do not look over your shoulder. They make themselves available with an open-door policy when advice and direction is requested. Business and Development Support: SIG have large in-house development teams which actively build and maintain the majority of the firm’s day-to-day tools. The result of this is that you get to interact directly with the people who make the systems you use. You are given the opportunity to directly communicate issues, bugs and recommendations to them. For larger projects, people can also voice their requests and have a say in the direction of development, while in some cases, individuals are asked to actively work with the tech teams to spec out and then test such systems. While major emphasis is put on individuals to drive their own development, the company do offer good in-house training programmes across a variety of topics – from tech skills (VBA, Python, SQL etc.), financial products, market structures, to management techniques. There is a large and supportive HR team who make themselves available to all and offer good guidance when called upon. Personal Development: I learned a great deal at SIG and firmly believe that had I spent the same amount of time working elsewhere, I would have gained only a fraction of the knowledge and skills that I have now. Personally, I expanded my knowledge on all sorts of financial instruments, exchanges, markets and technologies, learned technical languages in VBA, SQL and Python, and developed project management, people management and communication skills. Development, as mentioned above, is not simply handed to people. SIG provide the encouraging environment and supportive management, while leaving the rest to the individual to use their own initiative and drive to put in the hard work required to build knowledge and develop skills. You are given the freedom, what you do with it determines what you get out of your time at SIG. Benefits Package / Remuneration: Overall SIG pay pays well. It complements good take home salaries with a very generous benefits package which includes breakfast, lunch, gym, 5-a-side football, VHI, local store discounts, holiday gifts and merchandise, high expense holiday parties and prize money for various events (eg. all employees won $1,000 after the Eagles won the Super Bowl).","My time at SIG was overall very positive however there are of course areas for improvement: Poor bonus structure: As mentioned above, people are typically well remunerated in salary terms. However I don’t feel the bonus culture for Ops is in line with general expectations for a trading environment. Ops bonuses are set a year out and act as pre-defined salary extensions so long as pre-set goals are met. While this is the standard for many finance jobs, it does not work as well in a trading environment where, more often than not, individuals receive a bonus proportional to their results for the year. In Ops, should you have a year of above expected performance and in some cases realise unexpected wins for the firm (substantial cost savings, business developments etc.), bonuses do not meaningfully reflect this. Under resourced areas of business: During my time at SIG, there were pro-longed periods where certain areas of the firm (not just Ops) were under resourced. In some occasions, the issues may not have been foreseeable with unexpected departures however at other times the resource issue was due to poor planning, for example when well forecasted market changes required development focus and thus additional hires. The issue of low resources persisted for months and months in some cases and put noticeable additional pressures on various teams. Senior management communication: There were many periods during my time when communication from senior management on firm strategy and direction were lacking. While laying down this criticism I must acknowledge that management, operating as a private company in a highly competitive external trading environment, could not afford full transparency on strategic direction. However there were still pro-longed periods where I and many of my colleagues were not entirely sure on the direction of the firm or the what the long-term objectives were. Towards the end of my time at SIG, I did see attempts to improve upon this communication. There were also occasions when this lack of communication was compounded by uninspiring and flat, firm-wide addresses made by the CEO and other C-level management. While there is a huge amount of respect and admiration levelled at the feet of upper management for their experience and achievements, I felt that many staff who were less aware of their history and reputation were left deflated after hearing their addresses. The following are NOT cons and more realities of the job: Can be a demanding and pressurised environment – it is a trading firm after all! Fast paced means that targets and objective change regularly. Development is not hand-held. Freedom management offer can be perceived as a lack of direction – you must own your own development. There are some back office (mundane) elements, as there are with most jobs.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,No opinion of CEO,sig

The high starting salary relative to working at big 4 accounting firm quickly levels out after 2 years. Unlike the 2 years spent at an accounting firm, here you will not come out with professional exams with which you can expect and demand a considerably higher wage that effectively doubles once exams are completed, instead you will receive annual wage increases of little more than 2k a year. Also you will now be pigeon holed in the trading world with little bargaining power with respect to wages and a very shallow pool of jobs to swim even if willing to relocate to Europe. Do not be fooled into thinking a move to trading is possible, this has happened once in 10 years.The operations department has gone backwards over the last few years with key team leaders growing frustrated with the lack of resources and understanding afforded from senior ops management who seem out of depth and more concerned with managing upwards as opposed to what is best for their employees and the business. With this, one of the only benefits of this role, that being the learning,has disintegrated. Avoid this roll if alternatives exist","Thank you for your feedback. I was interested by your post and have considered the points you raised. At SIG, we put great effort toward building and evolving our graduate training programmes each year. For our Trading Operations Graduate Programme, this includes providing the most relevant training and education on the skills required for our graduates to be successful and ensuring that our compensation, benefits and perks are competitive with the market. We also provide growth opportunities to our employees through new projects and challenges, continued education, and our internal transfer programme. While most of our traders are hired directly into our Quantitative Trader Graduate Program, there are other transfer opportunities throughout the business that our employees can explore. We value each of our employees and I share your concerns when we lose individuals across the business. When individuals wish to explore new roles outside of SIG or continue their formal education, our goal is to ensure that we have depth in our teams to minimise the impact of these departures.

Good healthcare package Food and gym on site free of charge","Better to start career at larger firm which has a developed learning structure in place and promotes employee growth and development No structured training program to enhance operations staff knowledge of the products and trading. All learning is primarily asking questions to the right people. The advertising for the roles is very misleading. They are advertised in a way which implies heavy interaction with trading however as stated above the only knowledge to be gained of trading is by direct interaction with the traders. The day to day of the job is mundane, repetitive tasks which do not involve a huge amount of complexity. Reconciling versus prime broker data, crossing/blocking trades, liaising with cpty’s on settlement or other related issues. Even the potentially more interesting teams have a high level of mundanity in the role. No opportunities to move outside of the operations department. Some moves have been blocked in the past. Senior management of the operations department in Dublin seem slightly out of their depth and rely heavily on the knowledge and decision making of the line managers below them rather then making strategic decisions from the top down. In general I found that their knowledge of the products and trading was quite poor. Also personally wasn’t a fan of their management style. Very authoritarian and aggressive.

Wed Feb 24 2016 08:28:31 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,Chicago,Junior Trader in Chicago,First Year as a Junior Trader (Junior Relative Value Arb Trader),I have been working at TransMarket Group,4,"When you first start there is an in depth classroom based training program paired up with a few trading desk mentors. From here you get to move up at your own pace- depending on how quickly you pick up concepts\modeling and how well you execute the initial working strategy they give you. This is one of the key things they do right relative to the firms my friends work at. They give you an existing model that is making money and your goal is to fine tune it\come up with new ones. Once you do- you move up. -I have a masters degree from a top institution, and I would look at the initial training program as a PhD on steroids. While it was perhaps too aggressive due to balancing courses and work, everyone learned a lot. - Meritocracy- I was able to gain responsibility quickly and was just rewarded extremely well via bonus and promotion for my work this year -Culture- Everyone shares ideas, hangs out on the weekends, and encourages eachother- it reminds me of undergrad or a varsity team. In addition to this, they really have a no Ahole rule. Most people seem to volunteer and there is a matching charity program (I am told this is the first year for it though) -Team- I knew the team was smart when I joined- but I am in awe of the team TMG has put together. This ranges from the top students from top undergrad\grad\PhD programs, to top experienced software engineers, to senior level employees who have either run their own hedge fund or been a senior level employee at top tier banks\hedge funds. There is a reason they have a collection of some of the top talent from their competitors while no one seems to leave for our competitors. They even have one of the best former PMs at Citadel ever. While he was there he was their largest PM. -There is a lot of room for expansion. They are constantly trying out new products\trades. While there is no set path on when you will become a senior trader- if you succeed you can ultimately run a huge portfolio fairly quickly. You get to explore ideas a lot (although this is mostly unstructured) -Top of the line technology and technologists -Benefits including annual ski trip (amazing bonding opportunity) and a lot of free dinners. Free meals for breakfast and lunch -Amazing growth in PNL and headcount the last 7 years (perhaps the best in the prop industry) -Our future growth plans (expansion into new products, etc)","- While the initial training program was fantastic, and my mentors through out the year have really helped me- I would have liked more TMG coursework through out the year. The CEO personally taught a good portion of the training program, and in a recent company email indicated this would be fixed next year - The flat structure with no set promotion cycle can be tough to stomach initially. Having said this, I am in my first 1.5 years and when I see people that have been there for 3 or more leading their own desks and are partner- I get excited - The firm seems to be understaffed for all of the projects that are in the pipeline. This doesn't make sense considering the total amount of applications they get. On the most recent ski trip I was told we get 15,000+ applications per year -Minor growing pains which can be frustrating in the short term- but it is understandable because the firm has grown by over 100 people in the past several years. -While it doesn't really matter once you are here- the other reviews are correct. The office space is not as nice as a top Hedge Fund\Ibank. Once you get past the aesthetics you should be fine. Most likely waiting for the lease to expire to get a better office -While salaries are comparable to some firms, I believe they are on the low end. All in compensation seems to be the best in the business when I talk to my friends at other firms (at least this year was- this is my first bonus) -As a junior trader about 99% of my time is spent on my trade. I would like to be able to work with other desks to brainstorm\bounce ideas. While there is nothing stopping me on this- I would like to see it enforced. On this note- I often do not have enough time to see big picture what areas the firm is growing\etc. It seems like every day we have a new trade idea getting tested. Ideally there would be more communication on firmwide strategy expansion plans so the junior traders can help. A lot of us would be willing to work more than the standard 10-11 hour work day if this was the case. -There is no formal rotation program -I put work life balance as a 2\5 but I think this is only for the first couple of years (as expected). Some people have to work Asia shift (while standard in the industry, it still sucks). There used to be a Euro shift but that has moved to their Swiss office.",,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,,tmg

I've been here for 1.5 years and in that time, I've learned and grown more than I would have thought possible. - Almost everyone I've worked with in my corner of the Engineering world has been very kind, creative, and incredibly driven. - Since team size is small relative to the number of products, impact-per-person can be extremely significant. It's possible to be a star, even as a new employee. - Compensation is head-and-shoulders above similarly tenured roles in the rest of the industry. - Casual, geeky, tech-focused culture relative to other firms in this sector. - In-office extra-curriculars (giving talks, attending internal classes, organizing volunteering events) are readily available and encouraged by management - A strong lean towards the DIY in engineering projects means you'll probably learn a lot about parts of the software development process you might not elsewhere. - A gold star on your resume. TS is a heavy hitter as far as perceived engineering clout.","On the flip side, growth can sometimes be painful. - It somehow always seems like there's 20% more work to do than the amount of time there is to do it. Small teams with out-sized responsibilities in combination with the type of passionate/ambitious personality that TS seems to attract can produce an environment of intense self-imposed stress. - That same strong DIY lean? Means a lot of projects get built from 0 to 1 by one or two people, and fail to make the leap from 1 to 2 as it's realized they're a lot more difficult to make stable and production-ready than it was to produce an MVP. - As an adolescent company, TS is beginning to hit some phase changes with things like maintenance of aging software, management of organizational structure, and knowledge sharing. - Less hierarchical than many companies in its sector, but you can still feel like you're at the whims of a teetering stack of managerial decisions at times. It's often hard for bad news to propagate up the stack since people will soften what they say to higher-ups. This can lead to directional decisions being made without knowledge of the situation on the ground. - Front-end development is largely unsupported by the build/test infrastructure and varies wildly from team-to-team as each one learns separately to deal with the quirks.",,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,two_sigma
