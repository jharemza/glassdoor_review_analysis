It was part of the reason I said yes to coming here, and it's proven a smart decision each day since. It's hard to find a blend of smart, driven and nice, but DRW actively recruits for exactly that combination, and whatever they are doing, it is working. As a working mom, it's also been refreshing to experience how supportive the firm has been in enabling me to manage and accelerate my career while also having the flexibility to manage my other priorities. It appears this mentality holds true whatever those ""other"" priorities are -- family, a passion project, etc. The people here are celebrated not just for what they bring directly to their jobs but also for the other things that make them tick. It's also fun to be at a place with a proven track-record and a lot of success that is still constantly innovating and seeking new opportunities.

Places like Two Sigma, HRT, Jump, Citadel, etc. are very strongly embracing AI and have amazing presence, which makes them attract high caliber PhD students, smart undergrads, etc. who then tell their smart friends, and it becomes a virtuous cycle. Leaving DRW doesn't really give much credential in exit options - aside from a few trading firms, nobody seems to care that you've worked at DRW. Tech doesn't care and won't put you in interesting roles such as machine learning, and other well-known firms don't really care either from interviews.","Attracting smart people who are good colleagues and creating a balanced workplace are high priorities at DRW. We’re glad that was your experience. We also agree AI and machine learning have a role in our business, and we are currently investing in and using both.

We know there is still work to be done to maintain our culture as the company grows, and we can’t lose sight of it. We’re similarly focused on making sure that collaboration happens thoughtfully. When we can bring individuals and teams together to solve problems, we do. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our projects and systems, it’s not always possible. We’ll continue to work on confronting the siloes that do exist and encouraging people to identify where we can have meaningful exchange of skills, ideas and work product. Moving into a management role can be a challenging transition, especially when you take on responsibility for work that isn’t in your area of expertise.

Salary and benefits are good and the offices are nice.,"I will name a few issues, but really they are the symptom of a larger problem. They advertise great technology and charge you for it, but there is no significant technology that they can offer a trading group. Anything proprietary is generally owned by a different division and you will likely not have access to it. All the groups are separate. There is no collaboration, and that is somewhat by design. It's a collection of business with shared resource, so understand you will not get help with much unless it's pedigree items like hardware purchase or technical support. If you are a trader or have a trading business you are siloed off. Really they have mostly become a glorified backer of trading strategies, or if that was always their model it's not always advertised that way. There is definitely a shakeup in management. Lot's of recent defections, retirements, shifting of duties. That could end up being a good thing, but transition is hard. If they can find a way to set the tone for a little more collaboration DRW would be really great. Lot's of resources allocated to anything bitcoin or real estate, but they have such a good shell of a trading company that is ready to be rebuilt. Some divisions do great, but given the resources some cooperation at management and a more focused path would allow them to really move back to the top of the trading space where they really do belong.","We only get better when we acknowledge and act upon the things we need to improve, so we appreciate your honest feedback. Collaboration is critical and an area of focus for the firm – but as any organization grows from 100 people to more than 750 in just over a decade, the way people work together evolves. It's really important that collaboration happens in a thoughtful manner, and that decisions about resource allocation are driven by data. We recognize that what goes into those decisions isn't always visible throughout the organization. The industry is changing quickly and our business must do the same. That means transition and evolution for us internally, but it also means significant opportunity.",2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No opinion of CEO

The company makes a nice effort to appear socially conscious, and as though it cares for staff. Outside of management there are some really good people (and some management that are genuinely good)","The image that is painted is a completely false image. Senior management do not rally listen to the people doing the work, or make an effort to understand any problems. There are a number of poisonous people in key positions that make every tasks extremely difficult and instill a strongly negative moral. There is very little opportunity to influence and change, or to grow and develop within the company. Once you are seen to be capable at a basic task; you will be expected to continue this indefinitely at the determent to your own career development. There is very little job security and stability that will encroach widely into personal lives. You are always contacted and reachable with very little time to rest. The company cares ONLY for its profits, and will not think twice before cutting positions that are even overloaded with work to save a few cents to pay for a frivolous wall mural.","Thank you for your honest feedback – it all helps us get better. And that’s why we use regular anonymous surveys and Q&amp;A sessions with the company founders to identify where we need to improve. Creating more opportunities for employees to attend training and conferences and take on increased responsibility is one of the areas we’ve been focused on. As a company, we greatly value our people and we’re proud that so many choose to develop their careers with us. When a company grows as quickly as Vigilant has, it often needs to make long term business decisions that have difficult implications for teams and individuals. That’s never easy, and we’ll continue to keep the impact to our people top of mind.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,

I quit the company last year due to personal reasons, and the only thing I truly miss about this place is the few life long friendships I forged.","The 'fantastic' benefits are just a ruse for what is a poisonous and unhealthy work environment. There is a lot of favoritism going on for 'experienced' employees who often do not deserve to be working based on their skill set. The company is more interested in hiring beasts of burden who will work umpteen hours and will be satisfied with not moving ahead in their careers. As a result there is a lot of politics at play which rears its head only once you get a good understanding of the company. Job stability is close to none. I have seen some super talented employees being told they are doing amazing work and saving the company money, and then being laid off two weeks following that due to 'cost cutting'. It's a typical rhetoric for a smaller company that has been acquired by a larger company. Future candidates beware, and make sure you clarify what your role will actually pertain. What is mentioned during the interviews is starkly different from what you will experience when you start working. Working hours can be very inflexible and often times ruin your social life. You also stagnate as learning opportunities are limited even though you are promised that your career advancement if important to the company.","Thank you for your feedback. We’re glad to hear you built lasting relationships with your colleagues – it’s something that really matters to us. At the same time, we’re disappointed to hear about things you thought could be improved. We certainly work in a competitive industry, which leads to a fast-paced and sometimes fluid work environment, and we know it has to be the right fit for both us and each employee. We’ve been fortunate to have many people grow their careers as the company has grown and we’re proud of the benefits, perks and camaraderie that have led to a high retention rate, but we know there is always room to improve.
