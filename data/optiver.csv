Every year it gets better. - The company is managed on the basis of principles and values, not process or politics. - Those principles and values align very nicely with mine: -- Autonomy: there is very little hand-holding and extraordinarily high expectations of individuals in the company. The company rewards those that keep pushing those expectations higher with greater responsibility and authority. -- Collaboration: there are a lot of great fights over the right way to approach a given problem. When we're at our best, everyone in the fight has a strong opinion but is also listening to everyone else and continually re-evaluating that opinion as new information, ideas, and opinions are expressed. -- Prudence: the company carefully evaluates risk/reward trade-offs both when it comes to trading and technology decisions. The latest fads (cryptocurrency, esoteric programming languages, etc) are carefully evaluated, but reckless pursuit of them is frowned upon. I'll end with a sports analogy. Working at Optiver Chicago is like playing for the Patriots or the San Antonio Spurs. It certainly isn't for everyone. But if you like competing for the championship every year and always pushing yourself to be better, there's no better team to join.","If the company values do not align with yours, you will find it an increasingly frustrating place to work. Honestly, just read the cons from other posts and you can see how that plays out. If you find the principles above strange, out of fashion, or backwards, you'll agree with other people's cons.

Bonuses have been great in recent years. Work can be quite interesting and there is no red tape in between you and getting your ideas out there and implemented if they show promise. I've seen new employees hit the ground running and make significant contributions quickly. Great trader training program. If you are very motivated (or a genius, although I've seen some really smart people get cut) you can do really well for yourself here. Decent hours relative to some firms in the industry, although you can get better hours elsewhere.","Lots of pressure to always be on top of your game. They will not hesitate to cut you if you can't keep up with management's standards. A sizable portion of your compensation is determined by your individual performance, where the standards of judgement can be unclear. Management, who is responsible for this, clearly plays favorites (usually the top performers, but not necessarily). They are also very unforgiving when you make mistakes or need help to get something done. The management claims there is no stack ranking, but you're performance will be measured up against your peers come review time. Not much meaning behind your hard work other than making more $$ if you care about that sort of thing, so you will need to find motivation elsewhere. Guess it comes with the territory. I've seen certain members of management lash out and/or demean certain employees. Abysmal profit sharing/bonus scheme relative to other firms in the industry, especially for dev roles. Skews very heavily towards the top who's contributions are not clear. That being said, pay is still great for junior and senior employees alike. Usually not something thats brought up, but a large group of the particular type of brilliant person that Optiver attracts can get annoying or frustrating sometimes if you don't fit in well.

Working at these other companies really lets me appreciate working at Optiver and all the benefits therein. Compensation - salary, bonus, health insurance, 25 vacation days on top of all the market holidays, and the dollar for dollar 401k match make the compensation is top tier. Culture - incredibly strong culture. Almost everyone working here checks their ego at the door and the best ideas win. The focus is on long term growth and doing the right things not only for Optiver but for the market. Executives /leadership - The people steering the ship at Optiver not only have great vision and insight they know their employees and hang out and have a beer on Fridays after work. Outlook - Amazing outlook and growth. Optiver Chicago is the best at pricing options on the SP500 complex globally. Seeing the current trend of money moving into passive index funds Optiver is poised to keep growing even in a low volatility market. Work/life balance - The after hour and weekend work here is very limited and much less than when I worked at other large companies. You are treated like a person here and if you have a family emergency people will go out of their way to cover for you. Perks - Coffee barista, catered breakfast and lunch, huge variety of snacks and drinks, ping pong table, pool table, weekly massage, beer and wine available after work. All free.",Optiver is flat organization. Overall I think being flat is better but it could feel like growth is limited. You have to work at a high level each and everyday.

In contrast, there are also some people who can't get paid not even half of what they get paid at Optiver if they leave, hence lowering the morale. Not much incentive for shareholders to take risk (e.g. exploring new products - cryptos, equity options, swaps and swaptions, etc) The best traders don't always make the best managers (see what happened at Intel vs IBM), but there is no choice because managers get paid more.

Although salary is on the low side, with traders earning 85k USD regardless of seniority, bonuses can be high. When the company is doing well, a rookie can expect a bonus that is at least the same as annual salary, and the next promotion level can expect a bonus that is four times the rookie's. Rookies are generally promoted after 2 years. The work environment is comfortable. Casual dress means some traders wear shorts and flip-flops year-round. Lunch is catered daily, and snacks are provided in the kitchen.","Optiver has done a good job in recent years with its on-campus marketing (e.g., ""We improve the market"", ""Brilliantly different"", ""Collaboration and transparency"", etc.). However, there is an inconsistency between the company message and the reality for many of its employees. Optiver is no longer a small, tight-knit shop; it is a corporation. If given a choice between sticking to principles and maximizing shareholder value, Optiver will choose the latter. Employees have seen this time and again, with team members forced to leave under questionable, often politically-motivated circumstances. Optiver is a great short-term play. It's a good place to start your trading career. My advice is to learn as much as you can, but always be prepared to leave and join another company for the long-term.

Here are some points that highlight this: - Superb perks/benefits and compensation. Bonuses have been consistently high for the past few years, and are only going up. There will be plenty of 7 figure bonuses this year. - You can move up very quickly. It should only take you a few years to reach the highest trader level if you are doing well. - Unlike so many other trading firms, profits are shared, forming the foundation of the teamwork-oriented culture. There is a natural incentive for information sharing and collaboration, ""all you have to do is ask."" Everyone wants to see others succeed because we all want to see the pie get bigger. - Plenty of autonomy. Good traders learn to become good entrepreneurs, pursuing success through the projects they choose. As long as you can support your ideas (over competing ideas) with logic and data, you will be able to get the resources to execute them. - Excellent work-life balance. Most traders are here from 700AM-530PM. Most traders don't come in on weekends, though some choose to. - Plenty of transparency.","- When IT is busy, it can be difficult to get your idea or project developed in a timely manner. - Continuing education could be better, although we are working on this.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,

Sat Oct 03 2015 12:10:28 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Software Developer,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,A Principled Trading Company,I have been working at Optiver full-time for more than 5 years,7,"- Mission: We have a clear directive: Improve the market. I love the focus that mission brings in combination with its moral undertones. We only pursue strategies which actually add value to the world’s financial markets. And I see this play out every week as well. In meetings questions like “why should we be paid to this”, “is this a fair strategy”, and “is this money we should leave on the table” are constantly asked. It is so refreshing to work for a trading company which takes it duty to ensure stable, fair, transparent markets seriously. - Teamwork: The camaraderie, sense of togetherness, and practical outworking of the company structure are incredible. Within our office in Chicago, it feels like everyone is part of a tight-knit team that works together as true partners with no second-class citizens. Between offices there is a wonderful sense of friendly competition (every office wants the best results) balanced by the knowledge that we all share in each other’s success which motivates everyone to constantly sharing technology, strategies, and learnings. - Humility: Why are the most successful people at Optiver successful? Speaking for IT, the key is humility, being self-critical, proactively looking for critiques and advice to help yourself improve, and looking for your own faults before others. Our most senior people are the first ones to take the blame for something going wrong and push those around them to help learn from those mistakes and grow. - Intelligence: You can’t be a great company in this industry without incredibly smart people. And in addition to being some of the most humble, hardworking people I know, my colleagues are also incredibly smart. If we were ever to decide “let’s cut the person with the lowest IQ”, I’d need to start looking for a job… Thankfully I know we’ll never do that. :-)","- Professionalism Training: Because most new hires are fresh out of school, there is a need for and lack of training in “professionalism”: How to make a business case. How to produce meaningful statistics and not gibberish. How do you create, plan, and run a meeting. How do you stay organized and not drop the ball? How should you behave in a meeting? Etc. That many new hires don’t know these things is not a problem. The issue is the lack of internal development and mentoring in these areas. - Focus: Optiver has a lot of intelligent people, high quality traders, and opportunities to grow. But it feels like we’re at a giant buffet where every food option looks incredible. We’re half-way through the line, and we have a full plate and a choice: do we grab a second plate and keep moving or step back and re-evaluate what is best for our long-term health and short-term digestion? It often feels like we go for the second plate when we should ask: is that chocolate pie really going to be that good? We’ve tried it three times before and never been satisfied. Why do we think it will be good this time?",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

The bonuses are great compared to non-finance development jobs. However as a developer you are miles behind the traders in terms of bonuses, so be prepared to be working with youngsters that are on a multiple of your income. One of the great benefits is that there are no external customers, you are only developing solutions for internal use. This has some great upsides - you only work on projects that are really needed and make an immediate difference to the company. You can see your code go straight into production and directly interact with the users to get feedback. The work/life balance is extremely good compared to previous jobs I have had, you aren't really expected to do extra except to be on standby for external dependencies such as exchange upgrades. Usually the internal work is planned well in advance. The company does have a strong moral(!) compass in terms of trading behavior. We try to compete in a fair way with other market participants and although the phrase 'improve the market' is parroted a lot as a mission statement, I do think it is generally true (while trying to make money of course). There is also the cliche of getting to work with a lot of smart people, in this case it is definitely true.","If you have no interest in trading then you are not going to progress. Think of it is a trading company that also happens to do development. There is always more work than people and a lot of technical debt. There are so many products and markets we are trying to support that it's almost impossible to keep track of. Although the bonus scheme is open and visible, the shares scheme is completely opaque. There is relatively high staff turnover in all departments. The process isn't completely visible but if the company decides one day that they don't want you then they make you an offer to incentivize you to leave. Sometimes people disappear without a word and you wonder what happened because they seemed competent enough. The bonus structure has extremely coarse resolution, it doubles at each level so it makes an enormous difference to overall remuneration. It is not at all clear what the requirements for these levels are, it is completely at the discretion of your direct manager if you progress. The CTO position has been extremely unstable, the tech leadership at this level is constantly in flux. The team leads have been fairly stable despite this though. There is definitely a Dutch bias in the management positions, while progression generally seems to be based on merit, this is an exception.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

For example, 2017 was one of Optiver's best years- a year where most market makers struggled to turn a profit due to very low volatility. -Minimal hierarchy. If you have good ideas there's very little holding you back from executing. -Get to work on challenging quantitative problems that have a fast turn around time to see the results. -The mission statement of ""We improve the market"" is taken very seriously and means a lot to me. Practically this means we spend a lot of time trying to provide liquidity where it's actually needed (particularly in options and ETFs), help exchanges improve regulations to make them safer (think better error trade rules) etc.","Although the hours are reasonable by professional standards (10 hour days, no weekends), the work is intense. At Optiver you will be challenged to achieve beyond what you think is possible. I don't see this as a con because I find the work really enjoyable and stimulating. However if you aren't able to keep up or aren't passionate about working on these sort of problems, it will be not be fun.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Optiver nowadays sets the standard in many of the markets in which they are active. In my opinion a lot of the competitors lack a vision beyond trying to copy what Optiver does. Optiver has a flat corporate structure which allows traders to get a lot of responsibility right from the start. This offers great upside potential for people who are hard working and eager to learn as supposed to a career in a more corporate environment such as an investment bank. Desks are setup as teams which promotes knowledge exchange and cameraderie. Transfers between offices is something which is actively promoted by management. It offers you the opportunity to grow both on a career and personal level.,"Long hours which are (unfortunately) an industry standard.

You get the opportunity to work with really smart people who are keen to try new ideas. - Social events. We were very lucky to have such an awesome team who pulled together some of the best company events I've ever been to, and they do it with the intent to 'thank' the employees who make Optiver a great place to work. - There's no budget on development, which means you are encouraged to pursue further study or attend workshops and conferences. - Food! The chefs and their team are incredible. They get to know each of you and try their best to cater for everyone's needs. Level 7 is never short of awesome snacks and nutritious options.","- There's not a lot of career development within the organisation and this is purely based on the flat structure.

Tue Apr 10 2018 10:31:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,,Former Employee ,Hectic workplace with no tech culture,I worked at Optiver full-time,4,"Some decent perks: on-site barista, weekly chair massage, 30 vacation days. Lunch is cheap (not free) and most of the time it’s ok, but the choice is very limited. Sometimes you’ll only get something deep fried or a burger. The annoying thing is that they also limit the amount of food people can take, sometimes there’ll be a sign saying ‘1 piece per person’. The pay is decent for Dutch standards but not quite top-notch if you consider working in other countries and not just the Netherlands. Even in NL the compensation is already lagging behind the competition. A bonus is a big part of the compensation and can be taken away for any reason. There are still some pretty smart people working there, although more and more leave the company.","The company is constantly and deliberately understaffed. Even though your pay may be not the worst, as a software developer you’ll be doing at least a 3-person job - you’ll be a developer, project manager, and user support specialist. There’s pretty much no planning, things are done in a hectic way, it’s often unclear what needs to be done to move forward with a task/project. Optiver is a noisy and distracting workplace, it’s considered ok to have loud conversations when others around are trying to concentrate. There’re very limited options to work from home or away from desk, you won’t get a laptop or decent phone. While I worked there, there was a major reconstruction of the office being done, both outdoors and indoors. During that time sometimes it was virtually impossible to concentrate - there was loud sound of drilling, toxic smell of paint or burned plastic, extremely low temperatures during winter, even workers listening to radio during office hours... The company didn’t do anything to minimize these inconveniences, probably breaking quite a few workplace laws in the meantime. The technology stack they use is very limited and outdated. There’s no room for trying out new things in tech; they constantly emphasise that they’re a trading, not a tech company, and technology is just a tool to accomplish the business needs. They have pretty much non-existent IT support, you have to figure all out by yourself and the developer machine setup is very inconvenient. Projects in some teams can be interesting if you’re lucky but there’s also a lot of work done due to regulatory requirements or for ‘political’ reasons. The company is very hierarchical, even though it’s advertised as having a flat structure. The teams, instead of cooperating, often are very competitive against each other; between different offices (e.g. Amsterdam and Sydney) there is pretty much no cooperation at all. They are quite obviously favorizing Dutch employees; even though the Dutch comprise quite a bit less that 50% of the staff in Amsterdam, somehow the vast majority of team leadership/managerial positions are given to the Dutch. Overall, maybe it’s not the worst place to work and you can definitely make an impact there, but all the cons are just too much to make you want to stay there.",,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No opinion of CEO

Lots of amazing talent (both technical and leadership) has left over the last two thirds of 2017. Slow to pick up modern development practices and technologies. Below market rate base salary ('compensated' by a discretionary profit sharing scheme that can be taken away at any time). Upper management is opaque, and decision making by middle management often appears to be motivated by what's best for their careers rather than what's best for the company or their team. The level of ego among many of the technical specialists can be extreme at times. They're the best of the best - and they're not humble about it. Personal performance appraisal is directly linked to compensation. Which sounds great in theory, but the performance appraisal process is opaque.

A closer look shows that many of Optiver's claims stretch the truth and some are outright falsehoods. For instance, Optiver calls itself a ""Great Place to Work"", no doubt referring to its performance in the Best Places to Work in Australia survey, in which it achieved 2nd place in 2014. What Optiver neglects to mention is its paltry performance in recent years within the same survey, with placements of 3rd and 6th in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, in fact, Optiver failed to make the list entirely (25 total spots). It is concerning that an organisation that supposedly champions truth and merit invests so heavily in building its image. I suggest looking to third-party sources for verification -- Glassdoor's own Rating Trends is a good place to start. The truth is that Optiver Australia, which trades the Asian markets, has not been doing well. Following the exchange upgrades in Japan, which have made the exchange more deterministic (think winner takes all), Optiver has no longer been able to get as many trades as it shoots for. Mind you, Nikkei and Topix were once significant income streams. Add to the picture changes in Hong Kong regulations pertaining to Stamp Duty (think trading fees) that has forced Optiver to close its corresponding basket versus ETF desk, also a big money maker in the past. Take my advice, if you are choosing between Optiver and a competitor, go with the latter.
