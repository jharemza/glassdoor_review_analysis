You will find that top-tier talent is easily approachable, willing to collaborate, and often within arms-reach of you. The work you produce is valued and your opinions on implementation will be heard if you can sufficiently support your view. Employees who reach a point where they feel stuck in their career, or have a desire to seek out new challenges, have options. Those who have proven they can exceed expectations are given every opportunity to explore other areas of the firm where they may add value. Management recognizes this and is fully supportive of internal moves that better align employees with their core skills and interests. It is also a firm where your work has an immediate and tangible impact and you can quickly become the owner of a high-value process. This extends to work that may on the surface appear to be somewhat trivial but supports a critical function at the firm. Front-office colleagues and investment teams take pride in the hard work being done at every level and will often go out of their way to recognize individuals who continually deliver. There is constant focus on finding and working with cutting edge (not bleeding edge) technology that better positions the firm to succeed, and there is an underlying expectation that you will scrutinize and review prior implementations. There are endless complex problems to be solved and this seems to really foster a culture of innovation.","While the resources and opportunities are endless, it is ultimately up to you to determine how to best leverage them. No one is going to give you a full roadmap on how to navigate your role and grow your skillset. This can often be a challenge for those who thrive on structure or have a more traditional view of how their career should progress. Citadel is also constantly evolving and pushing the limits at all levels and this can be daunting for people who might not enjoy changing requirements, context-shifting or re-engineering recently completed work. Expectations are accordingly high, and this can sometime be overwhelming for employees who aren’t deeply invested in the task or problem at hand. Lastly, for central or common roles where there is no PnL tied directly to your name, finding ways to add value that can be quantified is always challenge, particularly for those that don’t have an interest in finance or fully appreciate what the main function of the firm it (or have a desire to learn it).",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

You can make an impact right away and have ownership over your projects. This comes with more responsibilities and you get to interact with the stakeholders of your work. Having ownership means that you can see your project from initial design through to production. Since the people that use the software that you build are internal clients, you get feedback constantly, resulting in a fast paced iteration process. You will be learning alot really quickly and get to develop not only technical skills, but also communication, leadership, and financial skills. teams are generally pretty small and generally collaborative. The company has a very flat sturcture and results oriented. As a junior developer, quant, or trader, you have many opportunities to interact with leaders in management across different functions.","Citadel is split among different businesses. As an engineer, you will be supporting traders and researchers who generate money for those businesses. Not all the businesses have the same culture and thus team experiences could differ. This also means that there will be a team with a business need and culture that you will find compelling. Some teams' work life balance isn't too great and do work very long hours. Usually it is because the projects they work on are very time sensitive and high margin. Turnover is relatively high as some new people may not fit in well with the team and/or business.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Management is full of people who make upper management happy, but can't manage down. Expect to get a great review and then get fired a couple months later without explanation.

You are encouraged to diversify your skillset by constantly learning on and off the job. On different projects, I have not only been the software developer but also a product manager, quant researcher or product evangelist based on what aspect of the project interested me. Talented peers from different backgrounds are always willing to help you learn new skills. * As someone who joined through the new grad program, a lot of support and guidance was provided in terms of classes, tech talks, speaker series, and various mentorship programs. The rotational program also allows you to find a team that is a perfect fit for you. * Titles mean very little at Citadel and the organization structure is very flat. Junior people who show promise are encouraged to take on more responsibility and are pulled into mission-critical projects. * Portfolio Managers, traders, and analysts appreciate the importance of technology and quant research and are constantly trying to incorporate it into their investment process. Citadel is especially rewarding for those engineers who are willing to put the effort to understand financial markets. Software developers are constantly reminded that they are there to solve problems and not just write code.","* Citadel demands 100% from its teams and individual members every year. This leads to a cycle of a multiyear period of stability (4-5 years) followed by a short period of turnover (6-8 months). This cycle has it's obvious cons but for ambitious team members, the period of turnover actually creates a lot of opportunities. * Software developers are encouraged to understand and solve problems. Sometimes these problems are ambiguous and the specs provided are loose. If you are scared by ambiguity, then this may not be the best place for you. 60-40% split of long term vs short term projects. Engineers, especially in the front office, may be required to context switch based on market conditions. * Citadel is a big consumer of open source projects but doesn't have a strong culture of contributing back to them.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

The culture is centered around performance - there is an obvious, stated mandate that everyone perform at their peak capability 100% of the time, while constantly stretching that peak as much as possible. This is not your traditional finance company culture of ""facetime"" whereby those who are visible at their desk 24/7 are promoted and praised. Instead, those who contribute, exceed their goals, and bring the whole team forward are considered the top performers. And, of course, top performers are rewarded accordingly - not with badges of pride or soft praise, but with concrete results. If that's what you're looking for, Citadel is the place to be. From a technologist's perspective, there are infinite opportunities to learn from your peers, many of whom have different backgrounds, or completely different skillsets to offer. You may find yourself working with former nuclear physicists, or former fed chairmen; each interaction is a chance to level-up each other, and to learn something new. Of course, there are the perks: breakfast and lunch available in the office, stipends for teams to hold events, frequent company-wide outings (read: sporting events, broadway shows, etc.), and top-notch comp.","As with any company in an expansion phase, there are some growing pains. That said, those at Citadel have been less than at companies in similar phases. There are active efforts to mitigate bureaucracy, but occasionally they fall a little short.

There is a large degree of autonomy in technical decision-making and architecture choices, and there is an emphasis on being able to contribute as widely and cross-functionally as possible, typical of startup environments where you have to ""wear many hats."" This always leaves one feeling like there is never a shortage of learning opportunities. At the same time, there are a large amount of resources to lean on, spanning compute infrastructure, data ingestion, infosec, etc. It is very straightforward to feel your impact on and stay connected to the business, as projects require direct and ongoing communication with stakeholders and are designed from the onset to be quantitatively measurable. I highly recommend the company for any self-motivated engineer or analyst who cares about being able to assess the effect of their contributions all the way to alpha generation and P&amp;L.","The amount of knowledge within the organization is staggering and sometimes makes you feel like you are drinking from an information firehose.

Excellent compensation and benefits at most levels, and within technology, if a tool or third party product is needed to fit a solution, cost is not of concern as long as the solution is proved out.","Citadel once could be described as a small firm full of exceptionally bright people that would not take no for an answer. Technologists would face a problem and work together to craft solutions for the firm. The company truly felt like one unit moving towards a common goal. As things changed, Ken unfortunately let in the belief that only persons with certain educational backgrounds or experience would lead to the next leg of success. I have seen definite growth in the business over the years, but the work environment has become cut-throat, toxic, and good ideas are often consumed by others not innovative enough to craft their own. Friendships have quickly been lost, people vanish constantly, giving a constant fear in the air of who is next on the chopping block, and process abounds as the firm grows, delaying project rollouts. The team atmosphere has been lost and it is unfortunately now living up to the reputation it has externally.",,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,No opinion of CEO

Many of the proprietary tools I use on a daily basis came from an engineer that thought ""wouldn't it be cool/useful if we built ,"" built it, and sold it to their colleagues and other stakeholders in the firm. Citadel has a strong culture of innovation and corporate entrepreneurship, and little bureaucracy. As an engineer, this is empowering.","* Turnover is high, even in the technology organization. Eighty percent of the people that I started with two years ago are no longer with the firm. * Recruiting and hiring managers aren't always on the same page.

Management is very engaged, knowledgeable, and in the weeds of what is going on. Nobody lasts at Citadel due to anything besides merit. Great compensation. Your salary will be the highest that there is in the industry. Catered breakfast/lunch/dinner.","There are two key problems with working in any BO/MO position at Citadel: 1. You have no future within the company doing anything besides what you are doing now. HR and your manager(s) may pretend like there will be opportunities, but that will never happen and you can look at the people at the firm for proof. Nobody transitions into anything desirable. Advancements are in title only. There are people that have been there for 10 years and are 'managers' and even directors that are doing the same menial work that interns will do. There is zero chance for professional growth or career development. The leadership is entrenched (if you would even want their jobs) and not leaving anytime soon. Stay far away if you are ambitious because, despite the name and compensation, it is very much a dead end for your career. Your only hope for meaningful career advancement is to leave for another firm after 3-5 years (which is all Citadel is trying to get out of you). 2. You are compensated more because you are expected to work dramatically more hours than comparable positions anywhere else. On an hourly basis, you are paid the same as people anywhere else, often even less. It is common to work >12hr days in a MO or BO role at Citadel and not uncommon to see people putting in 14 hour days and working weekends. This happens because there is consistent understaffing and a lack of respect for life outside of work. The claim from management is that you need to 'leverage technology,' which is mostly unsubstantiated rhetoric. Many things cannot (currently) be automated. This would be tolerable if there was any future for people willing to put in such work, but there is not.",,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,Approves of CEO,,

There are multiple bug tracking tools, code repository systems, wikis, and even chat/communication tools and it varies from department to department and team to team who uses what. This makes collaboration nearly impossible. - Very difficult to make an impact on the tech since it's so spread out. - You could end up on a very silo'd team with very little access to anything and your boss expects you to work all the time (including nights and weekends). - Lots of teams want to just buy solutions and build their own spaghetti systems instead of leveraging what's already been built elsewhere (within Citadel and from the open source community). Sometimes this isn't even really their fault - they just don't know what's out there. - Some of the code you'll find is comically bad because of deadlines, ""not invented here"" syndrome, and simply asking quants and traders to build software. This goes for use and abuse of databases and queuing technologies as well. - Very little service-oriented architecture. Lots of monoliths.

Free meals, but no cafeteria - they want you to work at your desk so you'll work longer hours. And so you'll stay in your little cubbyhole where you belong and not interact with anybody who ""doesn't need to know"" (a key buzzword at this paranoid firm).","Manager was horrendously insecure and micro-managed everything in a field he had no business or experience to justify doing so (if micro-managing is ever justifiable). HR and manager's boss didn't seem to care that he was doing this - even after informing them he bought an expensive board without consulting his subordinates and it was effectively useless for what he wanted to do with it - something that could have been avoided if this guy had put his ego aside and asked the people working for him with more experience & knowledge. Company has a highly secretive culture - at least two people were hired into our group without my knowledge. Granted, I wasn't a manager myself, but I'm generally accustomed to being permitted to interview candidates I'm going to work with and at least make a recommendation. You're also not allowed to talk to ANYONE because of this whole ""need to know"" BS that permeates the whole place. If you're coming from the tech sector and are used to being allowed to talk to people in other groups to get an idea of what it is they want, forget about doing that here. The Insecure Micro-Manager is your gatekeeper here. He will dictate the specifications and how he wants you to build your design. He will not care about your feedback or warnings about his architecture because his ego is too big. Then 2 weeks after you make your delivery and move on to the next project, Micro-Manager will tell you that the requirements weren't defined right and you need to go back to the old project and fix it so the internal customers will be happy. Something that clearly could be avoided by just letting us interact directly with the internal customers rather than carry this whole ""need to know"" concept to the paranoid extreme that exists at Citadel. I'll say two more things that sums up the company culture here. About 6 months through my one-year stint at this place, there was a company-wide meeting where a friend of CEO Ken Griffin gave a talk about something. Following the presentation, there was a reception afterward. It dawned on me that I knew NOBODY there beyond my manager and colleagues at this reception. And if you held a gun to my head today and told me to name more than 6 or 7 people who work for Citadel (never mind titles or departments or anything), I'd end up with a hole in my head.

Tack on the other perks (catered meals, in-house gym, discounts on things such as cellular plans and museum memberships, commuter benefits, the sheer amount of in-house education taught by industry & academic leaders) and you won't fit better overall compensation in Chicago. The culture of compliance (legally speaking) gives you a feeling of stability. As much as we all hate going to those meetings for ""re-education"", it's comforting to know that regulations are taken seriously and people are willing to reach out for help when they've made a mistake. Citadel proves firms can prosper regardless of the regulatory environment.","Like most hedge funds, the org chart is very flat. You will be rewarded through comp, but if you desire more than money, the upward mobility is pretty limited. For many years, there was a saying that Citadel is a ""technology firm that happens to trade"". This is ridiculous. The technology at Citadel is very outdated and many teams spend an equal amount of time working around the limitations of the infrastructure as they do building solutions to problems for the business they serve. Of course the darling businesses are allowed to buy whatever they need to get the job done, but for the other slow-but-steady money makers, technology can be extremely frustrating. This frustration transcends both the software (compilers, tool kits, etc.) and the hardware (storage subsystems, network infrastructure, etc.). Unless you have deferred comp (difficult to achieve) or are directly involved in a business (QR and trading), your comp is based on the overall performance of the firm and yourself,. but you have no direct way to participate in the gains (or losses) of the firm. A voluntary employee fund (or something along those lines) would be nice for those of us that are dedicated to the firm and want greater benefit from our contributions.\ The office is sterile. There is very little access to natural light (unless you happen to have an office), otherwise it's a fluorescent hell. The ""open cubicle"" concept is extremely detrimental to productivity, but I'm not sure it was done in the name of conformance and collaboration. In reality, it does nothing to foster collaboration outside of what a team is going to do naturally, with the added strikes of being noisy and disruptive. The politics in upper IT management can be paralyzing. We often do nothing out of fear or a Congressional-like inability to compromise, rather than stepping on some toes and doing what's needed to get the job done.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO
