The lucky people who joined early are now managers of the desks, some are great while others have no clue about management, barely shows up to work, and only promote those with glib tongues. The firm also hires high numbers of internationals in need of EB5 and significantly under pay them knowing they are less likely to leave. Very low base salaries compared to the industry. Bonuses are good for those who joined the firm early, but any later joiners are churned after they burn out on overnight shifts.

Lots of people drink on the job. They dress very casual for an office environment, like they are at home doing laundry.

These people have no sense of urgency, and then when things aren’t completed “on time” they blame others and pass the buck. They have high employee turn-over. I guess if you want to spend your life staring at a computer all day and drinking, this could be the job for you.

Wed Feb 24 2016 08:28:31 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,Chicago,Junior Trader in Chicago,First Year as a Junior Trader (Junior Relative Value Arb Trader),I have been working at TransMarket Group,4,"When you first start there is an in depth classroom based training program paired up with a few trading desk mentors. From here you get to move up at your own pace- depending on how quickly you pick up concepts\modeling and how well you execute the initial working strategy they give you. This is one of the key things they do right relative to the firms my friends work at. They give you an existing model that is making money and your goal is to fine tune it\come up with new ones. Once you do- you move up. -I have a masters degree from a top institution, and I would look at the initial training program as a PhD on steroids. While it was perhaps too aggressive due to balancing courses and work, everyone learned a lot. - Meritocracy- I was able to gain responsibility quickly and was just rewarded extremely well via bonus and promotion for my work this year -Culture- Everyone shares ideas, hangs out on the weekends, and encourages eachother- it reminds me of undergrad or a varsity team. In addition to this, they really have a no Ahole rule. Most people seem to volunteer and there is a matching charity program (I am told this is the first year for it though) -Team- I knew the team was smart when I joined- but I am in awe of the team TMG has put together. This ranges from the top students from top undergrad\grad\PhD programs, to top experienced software engineers, to senior level employees who have either run their own hedge fund or been a senior level employee at top tier banks\hedge funds. There is a reason they have a collection of some of the top talent from their competitors while no one seems to leave for our competitors. They even have one of the best former PMs at Citadel ever. While he was there he was their largest PM. -There is a lot of room for expansion. They are constantly trying out new products\trades. While there is no set path on when you will become a senior trader- if you succeed you can ultimately run a huge portfolio fairly quickly. You get to explore ideas a lot (although this is mostly unstructured) -Top of the line technology and technologists -Benefits including annual ski trip (amazing bonding opportunity) and a lot of free dinners. Free meals for breakfast and lunch -Amazing growth in PNL and headcount the last 7 years (perhaps the best in the prop industry) -Our future growth plans (expansion into new products, etc)","- While the initial training program was fantastic, and my mentors through out the year have really helped me- I would have liked more TMG coursework through out the year. The CEO personally taught a good portion of the training program, and in a recent company email indicated this would be fixed next year - The flat structure with no set promotion cycle can be tough to stomach initially. Having said this, I am in my first 1.5 years and when I see people that have been there for 3 or more leading their own desks and are partner- I get excited - The firm seems to be understaffed for all of the projects that are in the pipeline. This doesn't make sense considering the total amount of applications they get. On the most recent ski trip I was told we get 15,000+ applications per year -Minor growing pains which can be frustrating in the short term- but it is understandable because the firm has grown by over 100 people in the past several years. -While it doesn't really matter once you are here- the other reviews are correct. The office space is not as nice as a top Hedge Fund\Ibank. Once you get past the aesthetics you should be fine. Most likely waiting for the lease to expire to get a better office -While salaries are comparable to some firms, I believe they are on the low end. All in compensation seems to be the best in the business when I talk to my friends at other firms (at least this year was- this is my first bonus) -As a junior trader about 99% of my time is spent on my trade. I would like to be able to work with other desks to brainstorm\bounce ideas. While there is nothing stopping me on this- I would like to see it enforced. On this note- I often do not have enough time to see big picture what areas the firm is growing\etc. It seems like every day we have a new trade idea getting tested. Ideally there would be more communication on firmwide strategy expansion plans so the junior traders can help. A lot of us would be willing to work more than the standard 10-11 hour work day if this was the case. -There is no formal rotation program -I put work life balance as a 2\5 but I think this is only for the first couple of years (as expected). Some people have to work Asia shift (while standard in the industry, it still sucks). There used to be a Euro shift but that has moved to their Swiss office.",,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
