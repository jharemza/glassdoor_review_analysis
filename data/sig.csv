It can be hard to sit and focus on anything when you keep getting distracted and interrupted by the seating arrangements. - They will try to pay you as little as possible, so you need to know your worth and fight for it. - They do not care about work/life balance and expect you to give up a lot of your own free time to help the business. No WFH options, don't even try (during normal business operations anyway). They think anyone who wants to work from home is just a slacker. - Expect 50 hour work weeks, 45 minimum, not including your commute.

Wed Feb 26 2020 12:51:15 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,, ,Give it time,I have been working at Susquehanna International Group (SIG),0,"SIG is kind of a weird company, but once you learn to tryst it, the people, and the weirdness it’s a great and fun llave to work. They do a great job of supporting local businesses with the catering and are getting better about having women’s programming. Although it’s not necessarily a diverse environment (especially in technology or on the trading floor), it’s a very welcoming and inclusive environment. I think the difficulty with SIG is just really based on where you came from. If previously you worked somewhere with lots of hierarchy and titles and rigidity, SIG can be overwhelming in how relaxed and informal it can be. Other places might say they dress casual, but SIG actually means it. Yes people do actually wear shorts in the summer to work. If you are used to a micromanaged atmosphere, SIG can definitely take a while to get used to. I’m definitely very independent, but I have found for the most part people let you figure out the best pace for you to get your work down...and at first, this was scary. But if you learn to treat SIG with an honor system mentality you’ll do great. I was worried after reading reviews I would find payroll raises to be nonexistent.

I worked at SIG in the Technology space for almost twenty-three years. During that time, I worked with great people, worked on the latest technology and witnessed incredible growth. SIG’s biggest asset are its people. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people during my time there. People that are smart, hard-working, team oriented and respectful. I believe SIG strives to hire people with all of those qualities with equal emphasis on ALL of them. As a result, it promotes an environment of constant learning, challenges and success. It is not big leap to think that Technology plays a big role in most companies. It is the same at SIG but the difference being, SIG constantly assesses latest technology and if any of it can provide a competitive advantage, SIG will leverage it no matter how new it may be. They are in the business of assessing risk and that includes the use of technology. For a technologist this is the best type environment to learn, grow and be successful. As far as growth is concerned, over the last 23 years, I have seen SIG grow from 4 offices to 14 including international offices in Sydney, Dublin, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The bottom line is it did not stop growing the entire time I was there and there was no indication it was going to stop anytime soon. I could close this review with a pros and cons list but I think that can be read in other reviews. Some I would agree with and some I would not. One pro that I will always give SIG big kudos is in the area of benefits. They provided adoption assistance benefits 20 years ago during a time when it was not very common. I may be a bit biased but if this is the thought that always comes to mind after being at a company for over twenty years that speaks volumes about that company. It is a great company with great people, using great technology to fuel incredible growth. I think nothing more needs to be said.",All jobs and companies have their challenges.

Recession-proof company. Decent bonuses. Some sections much better than others.,"I worked for this company for 10 years and had some horrible experiences. Some people are impressed by the free breakfast and lunch but this just means the company gets another hour of work out of you in a mandatory 45 hour + week. The interview process is brutal and you often don't hear the results. The company is very conscious about paying as little as possible by way of salaries and using whatever leverage they can against you. For example a friend of mine was there for five years and never got a raise because her husband was undergoing cancer treatment and they knew she could not leave and lose the health insurance. During the 2008 crisis they told everyone there would be no raises and bonuses because the company had done poorly. In 2009 they told everyone that they would be no raises or bonuses because despite the fact that the company did extremely well, the market was tight and they were lucky to have jobs and they could replace all the employees easily. It wasn't until the market turned around and people began to leave that the company panicked and began giving raises again and asking what else they could do to make employees stay. They are happy to take advantage of employees situation when it suits them and then complain when employees are not loyal. Certain groups are much better than others and certain managers are excellent While others are terrible. The programmers and developers in the technology and are treated extremely well. The Enterprise Services Group was treated very poorly and managed very poorly. Lots of incompetence and Empire Building and many broken promises. Management takes care of other managers even when they're incompetent or even abusive while employees are expendable. They promised training and education but whenever you applied for it suddenly there wasn't time in the schedule for it. They would tell you that education was part of your compensation package but it was next to impossible to get any training. I personally took on a project that was supposed to have several other people on it, and yet when these other people were removed from the project I was expected to meet the deadlines unchanged without the resources. In fact I ended up having to buy some software on my own out of pocket to finish the project. I even put off my vacation to the next year to finish the project on time after being assured that I would be able to take my vacation the next year. When the project was done the following year my position was eliminated and I was let go after 10 years of service and was not paid for my 5 weeks of vacation untaken nor was I given any severance. Susquehanna has a staff of excellent lawyers and they're pretty sure that you won't sue them unless you are in management. Managers get excellent Severance packages. Don't get me wrong there's some good groups to work for and you can learn a lot although advancement is extremely Limited. They have a tendency to hire Traders &amp; quants in large numbers and then after a year firing the low performers.

I don't know how they choose who to elevate to management, but I saw two of the worst managers I have ever seen in my whole life while working here. ""Incompetent"" doesn't even begin to describe how these people behaved on a daily basis. Rude, aggressive, and outright hostile are more accurate descriptions (people being screamed at in front of their coworkers). For some reason, the ""great culture"" was touted to me when I was interviewing here, but in my experience, most people are only there to collect their check and cover their own backside. If you're considering working here, do not expect a collaborative environment. Do not expect to be welcomed into the prexisting tight-knit groups that are already there without a ton of effort. Keep your expectations very low and you can make a very nice salary working here, but I couldn't take this place any more than one year. My sanity is worth much more to me than the money I was earning by being gaslit by terrible management day after day.","Thank you for your feedback.

I can literally schedule a meeting and talk with anyone in technology. I won't get turned away. * If you are excelling at what you do, you are generally noticed and challenged more. * If you have ideas, management will listen and there is a good chance it can be implemented. Money spends can be justified and are not a barrier. * It's a financial industry company, but with a relaxed atmosphere and dress code. This means jeans (and shorts in the summer). * Good leadership at the top. The company thrives even in very tough markets. * Catered lunch and breakfast * Onsite gym and many other services like dry-cleaning pick up and onsite haircuts. There is even a fancy espresso bar. These are generally designed to avoid losing employee productivity time due to employees running out of the office, but they are nice perks. * Various company events, like holiday parties, night at the ballpark, 5k runs, etc. There is definitely a good social culture.","* Lack of a policy that allows employees to work from home. There are exceptions in certain cases, and this is changing a bit, but slowly compared to other tech-heavy companies. * The management structure is fairly flat. However, this also impacts the ability to get things done. You really do need to build consensus across many teams to get major initiatives done, and this will take time. * Hours can get long and impact the work-life balance, especially with the lack of work from home policy.

Overall very well structured compare to other hedge funds or prop shops. Lot's of documentations for everything. Everything is very well planned out for new comers to pick things up quickly. Decent compensation for the Philly area. Tons of talented people and hard workers. I think almost everyone SIG is giving all they got but some are just more talented than others.

Growth and mobility is hard because how well defined the company structure is. This is really a double edged sword. Everything is very well defined and breaking barriers is hard. I'd say it's good for the company over all but it kinda screws people over that's been doing the same job for many years without an option for growth. Yearly raises are terrible. You really need to hammer down you initial offer because expecting decent growth isn't going to happen. Yes some managers are just clocking it in and out, but that's not the majority. If you get one of those then I feel sorry for you. Some old tech still in play but a lot of people are working on phasing it out. Too many production freezes and sign offs for changes. They are there for good reasons but some are just offensive. It's like they think we graduated yesterday. I'd say half of all the freezes are completely worthless. Some luck does come into play for progression within the company. Depending on what work your manager assigns you, you might be an all star. Seen some people write some pretty impressive and important things, and some people just got lucky to write the important things. And those are usually turds.

The idea that SIG will leverage its Options expertise to build a strong institutional equities business has been unsuccessful as most equity investors do not care to understand derivatives (and vice versa). Senior Analysts and salespeople are generally comprised of has-beens and never-will-be’s, which is par for the course at most small boutique operations. Leadership is the real concern, as the defacto head of the institutional brokerage operation is a SIG-lifer with little brokerage experience, employing self-serving sycophantic department heads beneath him. Sales tends to rule over the Research Department with little regard or understanding of the Research process (scheduling firm-wide meetings and other important events during earnings season). Salespeople are loathe to make outgoing calls, save for one or two, and are typically interested in heading to the bar by 4:05pm. The Director of Research is a former salesperson who embodies the company’s lack of understanding of how to run a research business. This individual lacks research experience (and the respect of many senior analysts and associates), making up for that with canned speeches about the bright future of the business. Nearly 25% of the company’s Senior Research Analysts defected to competing organizations in the past year as the business continues to shrink under current leadership. The firm has make some questionable hires to replace departed analysts, including individuals who have been out of Equity Research for more than 3-4 years.

The Assistant Trader internship might be the best internship in America. The poker culture is also solid even though the founders and higher ups (not talking about BC/JA) think about the game the way one would in the early 2000's and not the mid 2010's.,"No diversity: almost all of the decision-making is done by white males. Only women they visibly hire are in HR – they will do their best to include the few minorities/women that they do hire in every recruiting picture possible. (Look for repeating faces it's hilarious) They will brag about their education department but it really isn't that incredible. Any real trader you ask will tell you how everything you'll learn about trading happens on the floor, talking to other practicing traders. There is one sharp fellow who was in education when I left, and I'm not sure why he isn't on the floor instead. The other two clowns up there are a soccer mom and a pompous neanderthal There's another issue that at least applies to incoming Assistant Traders, which is: at every point in your lifetime at SIG, you will be ""priced in"" to continue to the next level. At no point do you ever think it's a ""rational"" decision to stop working there. For starters, they pay interns more than anyone else, and give the best intern experience possible. This sells you on the idea of becoming an AT. Then you're an AT and grind pretty hard to make trading class, so how could you possibly leave SIG after you make it to that? In doing so, you sign a non-compete and lock yourself into a non-competitive salary (for trading) for the next 3 years. You've committed to living in Philadelphia for the next 1000 days, with the promise of cashing in on the first year after the non-compete. Then after you think your payday has arrived, they shoot you a lowball offer since they are well-aware you already have a stable girlfriend/maybe wife, are planning to have kids, already call Philadelphia ""home"", etc. At every stage of your relationship with this company, they are so deliberately thinking about how to extract maximum value out of their employees. There's no upward mobility any more. They've got everything in place, and it's REALLY tough to move up. If it were 2000 I would say you should definitely go work at SIG for this reason. No more, now they're just looking for cogs to make the system run smoothly. Then there are the minor things. It's a company worth 11 figures, yet the office decor is bland and there's no color/art/character to the place at all. The food is repetitive and outside of the salad bar, pretty unappetizing and unhealthy. Overall, if you are in SIG's hiring set (white/asian male who is good at math and has some common sense), you should either work: – at a smaller trading firm with people who have better taste (you'll work longer hours for more reward), OR – at a larger tech company like an Uber or Facebook, where it's still homogenous but at least you'll have laxer hours & good food, can live in a better city, and there's a bit more upward mobility, OR – grind it out at a small startup where you aren't drawing dead to win big, even though the hours will be rougher",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Recession proof. Some pockets of great people in what was Enterprise Technology. Enterprise Services on the other hand is a snake pit. Lots of opportunity to learn on your own. Not so big on training. Great parties. People say the free food but you are supposed to work through lunch. People who went outside to walk around the parking lot for air and sunshine were told that looked unprofessional. It is fun to watch the helicopter land and take off from the pad.,"I worked here for ten years and watched clear favoritism with some employees allowed to skate through their job based on if a manager liked them or if they were attractive. Saw many hard working individuals treated poorly. People with tremendous results and reviews year after year kicked out when managers changed. At least they take very good care of management when letting them go, they get good packages. Regular employees? Often let go with no severance, and, due to a quirk in their system, if you have vacation unused or carried over from the previous year? You lose it all. That's right. Five year, no severance, no vacation pay, please leave right now. THey have a dark culture in some areas, ruling by fear and intimidation. Reminding you at all times that they can replace you and you are lucky to have a job. They did that during the 2008-2010 dip. No raises and no bonuses in some cases...as they explained...we do not have to give you raises just because a year has passed. THe market for jobs is tight. So we have the upper hand. So...no raises. Some people went five years without a raise. Then when things got better they were shocked, shocked I say, when some of the best talent left. I watched people work 60+ hour weeks out of fear that less would lead them to be fired. I watched middle managers groomed by their abusive bosses to pass that abuse down the chain. Fear and intimidation. Sad. Again, not in Enterprise Technology, while that existed, but in Enterprise Services. And always take your vacation at the beginning of the year so if you are let go they don't cheat you out of that.",,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,No opinion of CEO

Fri Jan 31 2014 11:54:14 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Technology Manager,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",Current Employee ,The Crown Jewel of Wall Street,I have been working at Susquehanna International Group (SIG) full-time for more than 10 years,14,"Excellent culture. Very anti-corporate. The focus here is not about the titles, policies, micromanagement, politics, bureaucracy and layoffs when the P&L takes a hit which is what I experienced at other financial firms. It’s about collaboration, teaming, decision making, innovation, delivery and empowering people to be the best they can be to contribute to SIG’s success. I faced culture shock when I arrived at SIG but easily adapted once I realized how this culture contributes to SIG’s overall success and individual and team success. I’ll take this culture along with the jeans and sneakers and shorts in the summer over the suit and tie and wing tipped shoes I trashed years ago. I consider the managing directors to be approachable, friendly and fun, and passionate about their employees and company success. I also consider them to be some of the top risk managers on Wall Street. Their proven track record in trading and approach to running the company gives me confidence and comfort that we are part of a winning team especially when facing tough financial markets. We have very friendly, intelligent, skilled hard working employees committed to the success of the organization with the willingness to educate and help each other. Traders and Technologists are united partners that shape our overall Trading business. Employees have the opportunity to grow and have greater impact along the way if they are determined and committed to do so. Open communication and idea sharing is encouraged not discouraged. Fairly flat organization structure which contributes to the lack of politics and bureaucracy. As such, decisions are made very quickly and people are more productive. The Technology team is led by a CIO who is committed to ensuring that her team is core to the success of the business by delivering innovative solutions that give our business an edge on their competition. The team is unified, committed to innovation and delivering cutting edge and bleeding edge technologies to our trading business. This fosters an exciting, challenging and rewarding environment for technologists. Micromanagement is non-existent but exposure to all levels within the organization is the norm. We are focused on overcoming challenges and making the impossible possible. These are things I didn’t experience at previous employers. The workload is generally heavy and consistent across the Technology organization. This is why prioritization is a key area of focus. If you are looking for a 9 to 5 job with many breaks throughout the day then this is not be the place for you. If you are a highly motivated technologist looking to be challenged and busy and working with complex technologies then SIG could be the right place for you. I’ve seen a significant commitment to the evolution of our education programs such as co-operative and internship programs and our Technology Associates program. I’ve seen each produce opportunities for recent grads to join SIG full time and have successful careers over the years. These are a few examples of the many channels used to attract and hire top talent. Benefits and perks are good. Free breakfast/lunch is one of the better perks. In addition to being free, I don’t have to contend with traffic and lines at local food establishments wasting time. This allows me to get back to work faster. After working for other financial firms, I consider SIG to be the crown jewel of Wall Street. Among other things, the owners, people, culture, team approach and my ability to innovate and have impact is what keeps me at SIG. To me, this is the place to be if you if you want a challenging and rewarding career as a technologist at a financial firm.",The grass is not always greener but in most cases it’s much greener than any of the other Wall Street financial firms I worked at during my career. That along with my consistent losing streak at the annual poker tournament and in any of the many sweepstakes that take place at SIG throughout the year are the only cons that come to mind.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

You are presented with unique situations, difficult situations, and often have to move quickly. The technology organization actually keeps up with the times pretty well, you aren't using ancient programming technology or outdated hardware. The work culture is friendly and open. Engineers are given a lot of flexibility to solve problems the way they think is best. Very good fringe benefits like free food, gym, and on site hair cuts. Salary is very competitive for the area. The other engineers are generally pretty smart, and pretty willing to work as a team. In many other companies, different groups within a company form ""cliques"" that are often adversarial - not that way at SIG at all. Groups work together towards common goals and are very willing to help each other. I find this rare, and actually pretty awesome as an engineer.","-The work environment is not ideal if you're in the trading floor. If you're a software engineer that's used to an office, or even a cubicle, you're in for a rude awakening. It's noisy and there's no privacy. -Strict hours can be a pain. It's the nature of finance, but being expected to be in the building from 8-5 is irritating at times. Life happens. They're understanding of exceptions, but it goes against the company culture. -Similarly, they don't believe in remote work / telecommuting, which makes no sense for technology -I'll be blunt - the benefits stink. Health care is very expensive, and the 401k program is severely lacking. They only give their match in a lump sum the following year, and it takes 4 years to vest.

Working at SIG often feels like working in a small company, but with access to the resources of a large firm. - The pay is very competitive compared to other companies in the area. There are also lots of perks like the often-mentioned free breakfast and lunch, a full gym, exercise classes, on-site car wash services, and they are adding charging stations if you have an electric vehicle. - The culture here is EXCELLENT. The people who work here are generally very happy and the low turnover rate we have is a testament to that. - SIG has a very flat structure which I think helps foster the collegiate environment that is present here. On multiple occasions, I have gone to technologists (or business people) on other teams for help and have never been turned away, even when I was new to the company and the industry. - You won't see your good idea ignored in favor of a lesser idea by a ""Senior"" developer here, like I've seen happen at so many other development shops.

Teams collaborate heavily, but I rarely saw any managers step up to bat for their teams or open their mouths when a process could be improved or work being done was redundant. Status quo is the name of the game here, so don't expect to be given any opportunity to advance, simplify processes, or to have your input be valued. There are also multiple systems for doing nearly everything in technology. Want to get system access to a Server A? Request it through Webpage A. Want to get access to server B? Email Team B. There is so much wasted time with half completed projects and systems that barely do their intended function. Overall, I saw these problems pervading through the entire Bala Cynwyd office.

SIG preaches a collaborative environment, but there's a lot of compartmentalization and information hoarding. Furthermore, management definitely plays favorites, which puts you at a disadvantage if you're not the favorite. There's more egos here than the traditional shop, and the interview process is downright excruciating.

Perfect mix of ""down to earth"" people, who are also the smartest you will work with in one place. Big enough to be involved in all aspects of Wall Street and advanced technologies, but teams are small enough that no one developer feels lost in huge projects. The business is incredibly accessible. Questions on option trading, how an app should function, just go and talk to the key business people. Not only will they help you, they will respect you for taking the time to engage them. 3 weeks vacation to start. plus personal days. Plus unlimited sick days. It doesnt take 3 years to complete every project! People are geared to make things happen. At many levels technologists are catered to as the business recognizes the value they bring. Currently all developers moving to Quad Core Win 7 64 bit machines. Ya want it, request it, you got it. You dont need 1000 levels of approvals. ""I need 4 monitors because.."" and 2 days later the monitors show up. FREE LUNCH! Actually, breakfast too! Key aspect... the entrepreneurial spirit carries into technology.

If you can do the job the opportunities arent there VERY competitive salaries for the Philadelphia Market place. Not as high as New York, but higher than the majority of Philadelphia technology firms. Technologists PARTNER with the business. Many times the business gives general ideas ""We'd like to start trading _____ "" and tech is sort've like industry experts to say ""how about this... did you consider this... how about we do this first, then move on to....""","The same entrepreneurial spirit and autonomy can sometimes lead to frustration in getting dependent teams on the same page and schedule. A problem everywhere, but SIG moves through it with common sense. For those that want a structured promotion plan, SIG could be frustrating, There isnt a mult- level structure of ""You did good this year so now you are Computer Scientist Level III"". If you want that, go to Computer Science corporation. If you are kicking butt, you'll see it in your paycheck. If you want to be told what to do all the time... SIG isnt for you. Requirements aren't always solid. Business doesn't always know what they want. Technologists are expected to know technology AND the business. Many time (most) times technologists have to drive requirements and considerations. Techies who love this process do well SIG.

Where as a lot of companies say they run like a startup and have a meritocracy, SIG actually for the most part adhere's to this policy closely and is reflected from most of the managers down to the rank and file employees. There are a lot of different groups - even with technology, within SIG. Once you are here, there's a lot of potential to transition laterally if you find a particular interest (Market data, security, server-side, client-side, database..etc) and if you want to work close to the desk/traders, you generally can get that opportunity working for most of the groups here. The employee review structure is fair and a lot of attention is paid to compensation and performance review. Star performers are rewarded based on their contributions and it is possible to come here, do a great job, and reap the benefits - however, there is a limited upside as a technology employee here. The lions share of the bonuses goes towards traders and head traders here.","The counter-point to the relative flat structure and merit-based culture is, with the growth that they have been experiencing, especially in technology, the employee structure can feel a little hierarchical in the end and what you do can increasingly feel pigeon-holed. There's a lot of initiatives going on, a lot of projects flowing, but it's easy to increasingly feel like a cog in the wheel without actively going out and ask people from other departments are doing. If you are just starting out, especially in financial/trading industry, you might be better served working for a startup or boutique just to get the opportunity to do a little bit of everything and carve out a niche for yourself. To prevent yourself from settling into a cycle of overspecialization or monotony here, you definitely have to be mindful of actively asking for new projects and growth opportunities. There are some internal competition here as well, from each trading/technology group, as well as internal competition among workers in a particular group. The best technology people within software develop usually get new development projects and architectural leeway, whereas the middle of the pack and lower end performers get stuck supporting legacy systems. To some people, doing support and incremental fixes to existing systems is a safe and stressful job and they are okay with it. If you are particularly interested in writing performance intensive code or novel low level system code, you should specify that and try to get out of legacy support duties as soon as possible.",,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,Recommends,,Approves of CEO

The many pros outweigh the few cons and I would highly recommend SIG as a place to work. The working environment: SIG’s culture promotes a relaxed and open working environment where people are actively encouraged to interact. As a result, people can easily get to know one another on both a professional and personal level. The office is full of talented and knowledgeable people, many of whom are experts in their respective fields, and who are overwhelmingly friendly and approachable. An open plan office, genuinely friendly employees and a management team that openly encourages cross team and departmental interaction results in a very collaborative work place. This collaboration is supported by a shared understanding that working together will develop a stronger business and result in better outcomes for all. There is also the reality that with so many intelligent people in the office, working alone and producing sub-optimal outcomes will likely become very apparent very quickly. Trading Exposure: Operations directly support the day-to-day trading of the firm giving workers a great insight into the world of trading. Many operation teams sit alongside traders and work with them on everything from day-to-day trade flow management, to projects that can enhance trader’s tools to free up their time, to developing business opportunities in new financial products and markets. Operations in SIG is not like your traditional operations department found in Dublin. It offers true exposure to the front office. Proximity to trading often results in a faced paced and an exciting environment. Management Style: Management’s well communicated approach is to hire motivated, hardworking and smart individuals who can drive the business forward and not simply just do a job. People are empowered with the freedom to make their own decisions and take direct responsibility of their work. Innovation and initiative are encouraged, if you spot something that can be improved, management do not stand in your way in implementing positive change so long as you continue to perform your day-to-day responsibilities. In all, they provide people with a platform to prove their ability. Recognition and rewards for hard work often come in the form of enhanced responsibility and learning opportunities through taking ownership of new areas and tasks. When performing your job as expected, management do not look over your shoulder. They make themselves available with an open-door policy when advice and direction is requested. Business and Development Support: SIG have large in-house development teams which actively build and maintain the majority of the firm’s day-to-day tools. The result of this is that you get to interact directly with the people who make the systems you use. You are given the opportunity to directly communicate issues, bugs and recommendations to them. For larger projects, people can also voice their requests and have a say in the direction of development, while in some cases, individuals are asked to actively work with the tech teams to spec out and then test such systems. While major emphasis is put on individuals to drive their own development, the company do offer good in-house training programmes across a variety of topics – from tech skills (VBA, Python, SQL etc.), financial products, market structures, to management techniques. There is a large and supportive HR team who make themselves available to all and offer good guidance when called upon. Personal Development: I learned a great deal at SIG and firmly believe that had I spent the same amount of time working elsewhere, I would have gained only a fraction of the knowledge and skills that I have now. Personally, I expanded my knowledge on all sorts of financial instruments, exchanges, markets and technologies, learned technical languages in VBA, SQL and Python, and developed project management, people management and communication skills. Development, as mentioned above, is not simply handed to people. SIG provide the encouraging environment and supportive management, while leaving the rest to the individual to use their own initiative and drive to put in the hard work required to build knowledge and develop skills. You are given the freedom, what you do with it determines what you get out of your time at SIG. Benefits Package / Remuneration: Overall SIG pay pays well. It complements good take home salaries with a very generous benefits package which includes breakfast, lunch, gym, 5-a-side football, VHI, local store discounts, holiday gifts and merchandise, high expense holiday parties and prize money for various events (eg. all employees won $1,000 after the Eagles won the Super Bowl).","My time at SIG was overall very positive however there are of course areas for improvement: Poor bonus structure: As mentioned above, people are typically well remunerated in salary terms. However I don’t feel the bonus culture for Ops is in line with general expectations for a trading environment. Ops bonuses are set a year out and act as pre-defined salary extensions so long as pre-set goals are met. While this is the standard for many finance jobs, it does not work as well in a trading environment where, more often than not, individuals receive a bonus proportional to their results for the year. In Ops, should you have a year of above expected performance and in some cases realise unexpected wins for the firm (substantial cost savings, business developments etc.), bonuses do not meaningfully reflect this. Under resourced areas of business: During my time at SIG, there were pro-longed periods where certain areas of the firm (not just Ops) were under resourced. In some occasions, the issues may not have been foreseeable with unexpected departures however at other times the resource issue was due to poor planning, for example when well forecasted market changes required development focus and thus additional hires. The issue of low resources persisted for months and months in some cases and put noticeable additional pressures on various teams. Senior management communication: There were many periods during my time when communication from senior management on firm strategy and direction were lacking. While laying down this criticism I must acknowledge that management, operating as a private company in a highly competitive external trading environment, could not afford full transparency on strategic direction. However there were still pro-longed periods where I and many of my colleagues were not entirely sure on the direction of the firm or the what the long-term objectives were. Towards the end of my time at SIG, I did see attempts to improve upon this communication. There were also occasions when this lack of communication was compounded by uninspiring and flat, firm-wide addresses made by the CEO and other C-level management. While there is a huge amount of respect and admiration levelled at the feet of upper management for their experience and achievements, I felt that many staff who were less aware of their history and reputation were left deflated after hearing their addresses. The following are NOT cons and more realities of the job: Can be a demanding and pressurised environment – it is a trading firm after all! Fast paced means that targets and objective change regularly. Development is not hand-held. Freedom management offer can be perceived as a lack of direction – you must own your own development. There are some back office (mundane) elements, as there are with most jobs.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,No opinion of CEO

The high starting salary relative to working at big 4 accounting firm quickly levels out after 2 years. Unlike the 2 years spent at an accounting firm, here you will not come out with professional exams with which you can expect and demand a considerably higher wage that effectively doubles once exams are completed, instead you will receive annual wage increases of little more than 2k a year. Also you will now be pigeon holed in the trading world with little bargaining power with respect to wages and a very shallow pool of jobs to swim even if willing to relocate to Europe. Do not be fooled into thinking a move to trading is possible, this has happened once in 10 years.The operations department has gone backwards over the last few years with key team leaders growing frustrated with the lack of resources and understanding afforded from senior ops management who seem out of depth and more concerned with managing upwards as opposed to what is best for their employees and the business. With this, one of the only benefits of this role, that being the learning,has disintegrated. Avoid this roll if alternatives exist","Thank you for your feedback. I was interested by your post and have considered the points you raised. At SIG, we put great effort toward building and evolving our graduate training programmes each year. For our Trading Operations Graduate Programme, this includes providing the most relevant training and education on the skills required for our graduates to be successful and ensuring that our compensation, benefits and perks are competitive with the market. We also provide growth opportunities to our employees through new projects and challenges, continued education, and our internal transfer programme. While most of our traders are hired directly into our Quantitative Trader Graduate Program, there are other transfer opportunities throughout the business that our employees can explore. We value each of our employees and I share your concerns when we lose individuals across the business. When individuals wish to explore new roles outside of SIG or continue their formal education, our goal is to ensure that we have depth in our teams to minimise the impact of these departures.

If personality type is inquisitive and confident enough to ask the questions, the traders can be generous with their time. Line managers have good technical knowledge of the products traded and the mechanics of trading them however this has to be tempered with the fact that if they left this knowledge is not widely held. Good healthcare package Food and gym on site free of charge","Better to start career at larger firm which has a developed learning structure in place and promotes employee growth and development No structured training program to enhance operations staff knowledge of the products and trading. All learning is primarily asking questions to the right people. The advertising for the roles is very misleading. They are advertised in a way which implies heavy interaction with trading however as stated above the only knowledge to be gained of trading is by direct interaction with the traders. The day to day of the job is mundane, repetitive tasks which do not involve a huge amount of complexity. Reconciling versus prime broker data, crossing/blocking trades, liaising with cpty’s on settlement or other related issues. Even the potentially more interesting teams have a high level of mundanity in the role. No opportunities to move outside of the operations department. Some moves have been blocked in the past. Senior management of the operations department in Dublin seem slightly out of their depth and rely heavily on the knowledge and decision making of the line managers below them rather then making strategic decisions from the top down. In general I found that their knowledge of the products and trading was quite poor. Also personally wasn’t a fan of their management style. Very authoritarian and aggressive.
