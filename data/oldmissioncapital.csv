A testament to the firm's solid fundamental training.","- Questionable recruiting professionalism - Not all groups have equal opportunities for learning or to showcase talent - Opaque career advancement within the firm - Shockingly cliquey for its size. ""Flat"" structure only nominally. - Potential hires with strong quantitative/technical backgrounds are not given appropriate opportunities to demonstrate their value. - For a firm that has been recruiting since 2013 there are shockingly few survivors from successive hiring classes.",,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Tue Sep 13 2016 10:02:11 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Quantitative Trading,"Chicago, IL",Former Intern ,Excellent Summer Experience,I worked at Old Mission Capital,3,"The firm is small but very strong. The traders are smart and the way they tackle difficult analysis makes for an interesting mentoring experience. People are very friendly (save tense times during market hours) and help is always given upon request. The projects were difficult because they were very open ended, therefore the self imposed pressure to create meaningful analysis was immense. It was cool to see what other interns came up with, approaches varied wildly. Hours are decent, no pressure to stay late from the firm but (as mentioned before) the pressure to achieve something meaningful with the difficult studies sometimes meant staying in late by choice. In fact we were encouraged to make the most of Chicago rather than stay in and work late, very uplifting to see them care about work-life balance. However, most of the best learning experiences came from spending these hours talking to traders who also stayed late. The firm is very young in general and the culture is a great mix of work hard, play hard. There were many weekends when the traders were more than happy to include us in social events and outings (bars, fests, and other awesome night life). There was an abundance of official events and outings as well all of which made the internship a lot more fun.","Formal instruction was limited to the classes, which were well taught but limited in scope. As a result the projects felt like enormous tasks with little sense of ""correctness"" and I felt the need to overthink almost every step I took. Not enough scheduled trader-intern interaction. The latter portion of the internship included sitting at the desks as the traders trade. The value I see in this experience is not proportional to the number of weeks allotted to it. Additionally, expose interns to the work traders do AFTER market hours more.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
Thu Jan 28 2016 07:49:48 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Trader,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Happy as a Clam,I have been working at Old Mission Capital full-time for more than 3 years,0,"From the perspective of a person who has worked at various trading firms, and met enough people that work at even more, I can tell you this is a great place to work. The opportunity is great, the managing directors are willing to invest a lot into the development of employees, compensation is fair, and benefits are good. Coming out of school, I remember it being tough to differentiate the opportunities at one trading firm vs. another. Luckily, I ended up here and I will stay here as long as they let me.","Opportunities at a growing trading firm are entrepreneurial. Can be a con if you are looking for a job where you can coast. However, it can be viewed as a positive if you are looking for a place where to leverage your potential.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
Mon Dec 21 2015 13:53:37 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Trading Intern,"New York, NY",Former Intern ,Trader Summer Intern,I worked at Old Mission Capital for less than a year,3,Working at OMC was the best summer experience I ever had. Be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. Everyone is incredibly intelligent yet friendly. The senior people are very smart and experienced; they really know trading. They expect a lot from everyone who works there. The weekly poker tournaments were so fun and extremely competitive. Company outings were a weekly occurrence --- ranging from BBQ's and dinners to poker games and getting drinks after markets close. I want to give a special shout out to the Senior Quant who took a lot of time out of his days to teach me about programming and trading. Teaching is clearly something he is very passionate about and good at.,I can't think of a single downside but there's a 20 word minimum for this box.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
Fri Sep 18 2015 20:37:30 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Anonymous Intern,,Former Intern ,Great Place to Learn,I worked at Old Mission Capital for less than a year,2,"All of the traders are very intelligent people, and they are all willing to spend time explaining complex ideas. The partners are equally willing to help and spend A LOT of time discussing the interns' projects. For each of our projects we were assigned two official mentors, but everyone was super willing to help; the environment is open and collaborative. There was also the famous summer-long, firm-wide poker tournament. It was very exciting, and I learned a lot about poker and trading in general from that experience.","We probably didn't have as much formal instruction as a bigger firm, but we received plenty of attention individually as we worked on our projects. This isn't necessarily a con, but it depends on how you like to learn (i.e. by lecture or hands on).",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,Recommends,,
Thu Jan 29 2015 11:46:59 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Quantitative Trading,"Chicago, IL",Former Intern ,Amazing Place to Work and Learn,I worked at Old Mission Capital for less than a year,3,"-The people are the best part about Old Mission. From the traders to the programmers to the operations managers, everybody wanted me to succeed and everybody expected a high quality of work from me. The company is so small and the culture is so open, I never felt hesitant to go to any of the traders or even the managing partners to ask for help. These are the smartest people you will ever talk to, but they all have a knack for simplifying complex subject matter and explaining it to you in such a way that you retain the information. I worked at the Chicago office so those are the people who I spent the most time with, but I often had conference calls and held individual correspondence with the folks out in the New York office, and can safely say that every employee at Old Mission is of the highest quality. -The money was also good, if you're into that sort of thing. -Summer long poker tournament was fun and surprisingly educational. This isn't your grandma's poker tournament. These are people who could be pros in Vegas, and I was amazed at how much you can learn a lot about probability and trading just by playing poker every week. -Fully stocked kitchen and lunches from Chicago's best restaurants brought right to your desk every day.","-Long hours, but always by choice and never forced. There's just something about the office and the people in it that makes you want to stay for over 10 hours per day and do amazing work.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
