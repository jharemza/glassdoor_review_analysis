All levels of employees seem to be open to debate and new ideas. So there's a real chance to make an impact here.",They didn't hire me sooner.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,

Specific things I like: - smart people who work hard and care about the company and each other - high standards - great team - great perks: in-house chef, one medical membership, company trips - competitive pay","- long hours - you are given a lot of freedom, so if you're not careful you can over commit yourself",,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
Fri Jun 29 2018 05:25:32 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,,Current Employee ,Anonymous,I have been working at Hudson River Trading full-time,9,"The biggest ""pro"" is the partners not acting like your stereotypical executives (the 'I'm the man in charge' type). There are other leaders here that are also really humble and thoughtful people. I don't know that everyone understands how hard that is to find in a company, let alone a trading company. The company is really transparent about growth, profit, etc. They put a lot of trust into everyone that works for them. I've never had to worry about being sexually harassed here, where at every other job I have been. You have a lot of responsibilities and you'll share the work with everyone. If ""doing your job"" is all you're looking for, this isn't the place for you.",The amount of perks everyone has can create a culture of privilege among a few people.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
Tue Aug 29 2017 09:15:26 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time), Core Developer,,Current Employee ,Unbelievable culture and approach to full time employment.,I have been working at Hudson River Trading full-time for more than 3 years,26,"I get to spend the majority of my time on real computer science problems. Meetings are rare. Most problems have algorithmic depth in speed, readability and correctness. Many problems are unique to the space and unsolved (or unsolvable without restrictions). I have amazing co-workers. They are top-of-their-class, best-of-breed computer scientists who love improving and helping you improve. We've adopted processes by choice and not enforcement (such as code reviews, testing paradigms, distributed builds, daily releases, etc). Leaders embrace transparency. Every week there is a ""this week in trading"" post that discusses various topics. We've seen topics based on world events, improvements at HRT, postmortems, and so on. Nothing gets swept under the rug; we're better for it. There is no micro management. Discovery of problems (and their solutions) happen organically and cross-team. ""Do the right thing"" and ""make it better"" are seriously embraced mantras. Vacation time is actually yours. It's refreshing to see managers, leaders, co-workers take, encourage, and be encouraged to enjoy their vacation time.","Most positive feedback is implicit. On the other hand negative feedback is actively given. It is difficult to gauge expected performance even with quarterly reviews. It is even harder to figure out how to exceed expectations. Individual growth comes from within. There isn't room for hierarchical growth. This isn't a con for me, but might be for you if it's something you look forward to.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,
