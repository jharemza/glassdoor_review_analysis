I've been here for 1.5 years and in that time, I've learned and grown more than I would have thought possible. - Almost everyone I've worked with in my corner of the Engineering world has been very kind, creative, and incredibly driven. - Since team size is small relative to the number of products, impact-per-person can be extremely significant. It's possible to be a star, even as a new employee. - Compensation is head-and-shoulders above similarly tenured roles in the rest of the industry. - Casual, geeky, tech-focused culture relative to other firms in this sector. - In-office extra-curriculars (giving talks, attending internal classes, organizing volunteering events) are readily available and encouraged by management - A strong lean towards the DIY in engineering projects means you'll probably learn a lot about parts of the software development process you might not elsewhere. - A gold star on your resume. TS is a heavy hitter as far as perceived engineering clout.","On the flip side, growth can sometimes be painful. - It somehow always seems like there's 20% more work to do than the amount of time there is to do it. Small teams with out-sized responsibilities in combination with the type of passionate/ambitious personality that TS seems to attract can produce an environment of intense self-imposed stress. - That same strong DIY lean? Means a lot of projects get built from 0 to 1 by one or two people, and fail to make the leap from 1 to 2 as it's realized they're a lot more difficult to make stable and production-ready than it was to produce an MVP. - As an adolescent company, TS is beginning to hit some phase changes with things like maintenance of aging software, management of organizational structure, and knowledge sharing. - Less hierarchical than many companies in its sector, but you can still feel like you're at the whims of a teetering stack of managerial decisions at times. It's often hard for bad news to propagate up the stack since people will soften what they say to higher-ups. This can lead to directional decisions being made without knowledge of the situation on the ground. - Front-end development is largely unsupported by the build/test infrastructure and varies wildly from team-to-team as each one learns separately to deal with the quirks.",,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO
