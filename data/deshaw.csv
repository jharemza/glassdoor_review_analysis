It's dog eat dog. Managers and their direct reports are competing for a slice of the same pie. Search for ""I actually never really intended to stay in finance, it was just the only real job I could get with my number theory skills."" using your favorite search engine. * Extremely high pay inequality. Entry quants and developers are making $200-250K while MDs are making $5-10M and the head honcho is making $50-100M. Meanwhile the original founder is raking in $500M+ and doesn't even show up to work any more. * Pay is opaque. You'll get a raise, you won't know why. Your pay will get cut, you won't know why. Bonuses given only annually. * Failure rate of projects is extremely high (90%+). * Nobody here knows how to manage well. You'll be micromanaged until you need to see a shrink. Stifling atmosphere. * All the best people have left owing to the above issues. Some groups have attrition as high as 30% / year. People leaving both from the top and the bottom. * Company's best days are behind it. * Amount of hard work required to be ""successful"" is insane these days. All the low hanging fruit has been eaten. You will have to achieve several Einsteins in a row to make money here. * Your success depends on not only how hard you work, but mostly on which projects get assigned to you. Projects vary widely in their chances of success and their difficulty level. If you get difficult, unlikely to succeed projects, you won't be successful. You will then be perceived as being stupid. This will lead to you not getting good projects in the future. The vicious death spiral will lead to you quitting. The people running the show don't want to understand this because they enjoy their feeling of superiority for having succeeded and being able to call you a stupid failure. * For developers - ancient tech stack. They laugh at the idea of contributing to the open source community. They are insular, outdated, and way behind the times. You will get tired of it quickly. * Laptops only by special request. You'll be chained to an aging Dell desktop machine running an old version of Windows. * Secretive. Little collaboration. Sharing of work and results limited to tiny peer groups (2-5 people). * Slippery recruiting. ""Sell days"" in which you'll be lied to in the face until you join.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO

Shaw & Co. - Investment Firm,4,"The pay is great. Lots of bright people work for the firm, including management and support staff. For a financial services firm in particular, this company places control in the hands of the technologists; many of the senior managers have PhD's in technical disciplines. There is potential for large bonuses and advancement within the firm, or so I am told. Like many software companies, there are free beverages and snacks. The firm is structured as a meritocracy. The company has shower facilities on site in the main office. Some might appreciate the firm's location just off of Sixth Avenue in midtown Manhattan.","I felt that the picture my interviewers painted of my position was very different from the reality of the position. The firm hires over-qualified people for every position, which means that your position may not be fun or challenging, and moving up is that much more difficult. Fast paced, high stress environment. Health plan had a high deductible. The downside of being organized as a meritocracy is that it takes a long, long time to move anywhere. The company is growing at a very rapid pace, so the average experience of employees at the firm is much lower than it once was.

Shaw & Co. - Investment Firm,2,"A few of the best reasons to work for D. E. Shaw are the laid back atmosphere, great benefits and wonderful coworkers. There is no dress code, and only 4 titles in the entire company. While this might seem overwhelming at first, it is nice to not have an emphasis on needing to move up a title every two years. Your career path here can be much more free form and this is reflected in D. E. Shaw's academic nature. Extensive benefits for all employees are a definite perk and everyone who works here tends to be very motivated and smart but also concerned about their lives outside of work. It's definitely a great balance of everything.","Sometimes the academic atmosphere can be a downside. Unless you are the type to figure out what you want to do next and go after it, the opportunity will certainly not come to you like at some more strictly traditional hierarchical companies. The good news is that most of the employees at D. E. Shaw are very smart, enjoy what they do, and know how to go about taking the desired next step in their careers. The senior leadership is very competent and I think the future is bright for the company as a while. While not necessarily considered by me to be a downside, I would recommend that self-moitvated individuals work for the company since I see them as more likely to succeed in this type of an atmosphere.",,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,,Approves of CEO,,

It's a very collegial atmosphere where collaboration on both work and extra curriculars (e.g. green initiatives, running club) is encouraged. The company hires interesting people so many people have creative hobbies (everything from writing to acting to stand up comedy) so it's not your typical financial investment firm! The benefits are great -- they include $2/month health insurance, free snacks, subsidized gym memberships, games dispersed around the office (foosball, Wii Guitar Hero, etc...), and great company parties. Work/life balance is generally good and most of the admin jobs are created to appeal to artists from Ivy League schools who need to support their craft with a well paid 9-5 job with a flexible schedule.","Because of the rigorous recruiting policy, it can take months to be hired or hire new employees into your group. The later can cause work overload. Also, some departments have limited opportunities for growth/promotions, but I do feel the selection process is fair.
